## Manual upload via an API

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ## Execute the script
      1. Use the Confluence Query Language (CQL) to create a script.
      2. Ensure the script interacts with the RAG system to collect and prepare data for analysis.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Upload the script to cloud storage
      1. **Select Cloud Storage**:
          * **Azure Blob Storage**: Use the Azure Storage SDK or Azure Blob Storage API to authenticate and upload the script.
          * **Amazon S3 Buckets**: Use the AWS SDK or Amazon S3 API to authenticate and upload the script.
      2. **Compliance**:
          * Ensure the script adheres to predefined naming conventions and structure for the indexing pipeline.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Authenticate with New Relic
    
      Provide your New Relic API key, this key is used to retrieve performance data or push custom events/data.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Trigger the indexing pipeline

      1. The indexing pipeline triggers automatically after the script upload and authentication.
      2. Validate the script.
      3. Index the data retrieved or generated by the script.
      4. Process the indexed data based on specific criteria or rules in the quickstart pipeline.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Monitor and Log the process
    
      Use the RAG system's monitoring and logging capabilities to track script execution and indexing pipeline status via a dashboard or API endpoints.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Notification of completion and error handling

    Receive notifications upon process completion via your preferred method (e.g., email, webhook). If errors occur, the system captures details and notifies you for troubleshooting and resolution.
