Dashboards are central to your New Relic experience, and you now have access to all of your dashboards right from your IDE. Look for the <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT> icon in CodeStream's global navigation to search for any dashboard, or easily access your favorites.

Just click on a dashboard to display it. No need to switch to your web browser.
