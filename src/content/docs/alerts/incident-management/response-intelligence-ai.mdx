The Issue page, now integrated with New Relic AI, offers real-time insights to help reduce the mean time to resolution (MTTR) of issues and incidents. It brings together the key details of an incident into a single view, enabling you to quickly understand the context of an issue without navigating through multiple screens.

The AI-powered issue page provides a concise summary that includes the affected entity, the severity of the issue, an explanation of the alert condition, and additional details to assist with debugging. Additionally, the issue page includes a new ‘overview’ tab with three widgets that address the most critical questions first responders ask when dealing with an issue.

## What’s impacted?
First responders need to assess the "blast radius" to determine the severity of an issue and decide on the next steps. This widget provides an overview of the affected entities along with the impact to the end users of the application or service.

## What happened previously?
Many IT issues tend to reoccur. Knowing if an issue has happened before, why it occurred, and how it was resolved can save first responders valuable time during an incident. To support this, customers can use the widget to link their existing retrospective or postmortem documents. By leveraging retrieval augmented generation (RAG), the New Relic AI platform will index and store this information for future contextual reference. Once configured, first responders will see a summary of similar past issues, along with links to the retrospective documents for detailed analysis.

## What to check?
First responders often need contextual guidance on immediate actions to mitigate an issue. This widget provides customized steps to help them quickly restore services to normal operational levels. Additionally, the Potential causes tab identifies likely causes through causal analysis, covering a range of possible anomalies and performance issues. For more information, refer to casual analysis.
