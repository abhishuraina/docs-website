<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

<DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> in New Relic uses historical data to predict when a static threshold is going to be exceeded. This feature creates alerts before actual breaches occur. your can take corrective measures before issues escalate. This helps you to reduce downtime and improve system reliability. You can configure predictive alerts only for the static thresholds.

You can set how far you want to predict into the future, providing flexibility in your alerting strategy. When a predicted value touches the static threshold, a predictive alert event triggers. The event title has the prefix **Prediction: ** to help you identify it.

<Callout variant="tip">
  New Relic currently uses the [Holt-Winters model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Triple_exponential_smoothing_(Holt_Winters)) for predicting, which reliably captures seasonal patterns and trends in your data.
</Callout>

To enroll in <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT>, refer to the **Trial & Preview** section.

## Set predictive alert on a chart [#set-predictive-alert]
To set an alert condition with the predictive alert capability, follow these steps:

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Create an alert condition [#create-alert-condition]

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Alert Conditions**</DNT>.
    2. To create a new alert, click <DNT>**+ New alert condition > Use guided mode**</DNT>. You can also write a NRQL query to create an alert condition.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set static thresholds [#set-static-thresholds]

  If you are using the guided mode, follow the on-screen instuctions until you get to to the <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> section. If you are writing a NRQL query, run the query to get the data on the chart, and click <DNT>**Next**</DNT> to get to the <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> section.

  1. If you want to fine-tune your signal, in the <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> section, update the following:
      * Data aggregation
      * Gap filling strategy
      * Evaluation delay

  2. Under <DNT>**Set condition thresholds**</DNT>, set a static threshold for the alert condition.


  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set predictive alert [#set-predictive-alert]
    To open an alert event when predicted signals crosses your threshold, follow these steps:

    1. Under <DNT>**Set condition thresholds**</DNT>, enable the <DNT>**Predictive alert**</DNT> toggle.
    2. Set a look ahead time for the predictive alert. This is the time in the future you want to predict the signal.
        * Minimum look ahead time: Two times of the Window duration.
        * Maximum look ahead time: 360 TIMES of the Window duration.
    3. Set the predicted alert event behavior, when the actual signal crosses the threshold.
        * Close predicted alert event and open an actual alert event.
        * Continue to keep the predicted alert event open.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Continuing to keep the predicted alert event open keeps the issue page less noisy.

  </Step>

## Default prediction range [#default-prediction-range]
When you add a prediction to a chart, the `PREDICT` function appends to the existing chart query with the following default behaviors.
* **Prediction range**: Projects 20% of the total time specified in your query window, allowing you to see a short-term projection based on current trends.
* **Historical data**: Processes historical data from the current query window and the two preceding ones to generate predictions.
* **Time interval**: Matches the data point interval of the prediction on the query window, ensuring consistency in data projection.
