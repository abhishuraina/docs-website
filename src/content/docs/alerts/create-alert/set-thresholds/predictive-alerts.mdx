<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

<DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> in New Relic uses historical data to predict when a static threshold is going to be exceeded. This feature creates alerts before actual breaches occur. your can take corrective measures before issues escalate. This helps you to reduce downtime and improve system reliability. You can configure predictive alerts only for the static thresholds.

You can set how far you want to predict into the future, providing flexibility in your alerting strategy. When a predicted value touches the static threshold, a predictive alert event triggers. The event title has the prefix **Prediction: ** to help you identify it.

<Callout variant="tip">
  New Relic currently uses the [Holt-Winters model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Triple_exponential_smoothing_(Holt_Winters)) for predicting, which reliably captures seasonal patterns and trends in your data.
</Callout>

To enroll in <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT>, refer to the **Trial & Preview** section.

## Set predictive alert on a chart [#set-predictive-alert]
To set an alert condition with the predictive alert capability, follow these steps:

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Create an alert condition [#create-alert-condition]

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Alert Conditions**</DNT>.
    2. To create a new alert, click <DNT>**+ New alert condition > Use guided mode**</DNT>. You can also write a NRQL query to create an alert condition.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set thresholds [#set-thresholds]

  To add prediction, from the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu, select <DNT>**Predict trend**</DNT>  
  In **Data Explorer**, The prediction trend appears on the chart, projecting future trends. The prediction range is automatically set to 20% of the query window, and highlighted in gray. The graph appears in dotted lines within the forecast range. 

  The chart query populates with the `PREDICT` function. You can [refine the query](/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-prediction) according to your requirements and run it to get the updated trend.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add to dashboard [#add-to-dashboard]

    1. To add the chart with prediction to a dashboard, click <DNT>**Add to dashboard**</DNT>.
    2. Enter a widget name.
    3. Select a dashboard in which you want to add the widget, or create a new dashboard for it.

    You can now view the chart with prediction on the selected dashboard.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Default prediction range [#default-prediction-range]
When you add a prediction to a chart, the `PREDICT` function appends to the existing chart query with the following default behaviors.
* **Prediction range**: Projects 20% of the total time specified in your query window, allowing you to see a short-term projection based on current trends.
* **Historical data**: Processes historical data from the current query window and the two preceding ones to generate predictions.
* **Time interval**: Matches the data point interval of the prediction on the query window, ensuring consistency in data projection.
