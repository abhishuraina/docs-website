<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

<DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> work similarly to static threshold(/docs/alerts/create-alert/set-thresholds/set-thresholds-alert-condition) condtions with the difference being that rather that alerting when your signal breaches the threshold, the alert is triggered when the signal is <DNT>**predicted**</DNT> to breach the threshold. Using your historical data, we fit a predictive model to your signal. With each incoming data point, a prediction is made of up to 360 steps into the future (a step is equal to the signals [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration)). If any of the predicted data points breaches your static threshold with the settings specified when you set up the condtion, an alert will be triggered. By being alerted before a problem might occur, you will be able to take corrective measure before a potential problem happens.

Examples of situations where you might want to utilize a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT>:
* EXAMPLE 1
* EXAMPLE 2
* EXAMPLE 3

Currently, <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> only supports the <DNT>**[Holt-Winters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Triple_exponential_smoothing_(Holt_Winters))**</DNT> algorithm, also known as exponential smoothing, for both seasonal and non-seasonal time series. This is a commonly used and standard algorithm for forecasting and prediction tasks. When fitting a model to your data, we choose either seasonal or non-seasonal based upon the behavior of your historical data. We currently support seasonalities of hourly, daily, and weekly. In order to model seasonal patterns in your data, we must have at least 3 times the season length worth of data. So in order to properly model seasonal patterns for hourly, daily, and weekly seasonality, we need to have seen at least 3 hours, 3 days, and 3 weeks of data respectively. For <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT>, the season length is determined using your historical data and the maximum allowed seasonality is based on your set [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration). For example, this means that if your data has a weekly seasonal pattern, the minimum window duration that is supported is 10 minutes. The minimum required window durations for each supported season length are summarized in the following table:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        <DNT>
          **Season Length**
        </DNT>
      </th>

      <th>
        Minimum Required Window Duration
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Hourly
      </td>

      <td>
        1 minute
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Daily
      </td>

      <td>
        2 minutes
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Weekly
      </td>

      <td>
        10 minutes
      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

In addition to the season length, the amount of historical data used to train the predictive model is dependent upon your time series' window duration. A window duration of 1 minute will result in approximately 2.5 days of historical data being used. A window duration of 10 minutes will result in approximately 25 days of historical data being used.

## Enabling <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT>  [#enable-predictive-alerts]
The <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> feature is available only to **[Advanced Compute](https://newrelic.com/pricing/compute#pricing_plan-compute)** customers. To enroll, navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Administration](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal) > Preview & Trials**</DNT>, and enable the <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> feature.

## Steps for setting up a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT> condition [#set-predictive-threshold]
To set or update an alert condition with the predictive capability, follow these steps:

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Edit or set up a new alert condition [#create-alert-condition]

    #### To edit an existing alert condition:
    1. Select an alert condition from <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Alert Conditions**</DNT>, and edit the <DNT>**Signal behavior**</DNT>.
    2. From the <DNT>**Signal behavior**</DNT> section, click <DNT>**Edit**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> page opens.


    
    #### To set up a new alert condition:
    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Alert Conditions**</DNT>.
    2. Click <DNT>**+ New alert condition > Use guided mode**</DNT>. You can also write a NRQL query to create an alert condition.
    3. If you are using the guided mode, follow the on-screen instuctions till you are at the <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> section. If you are writing a NRQL query, run the query to get the data on the chart, and click <DNT>**Next**</DNT> to get to the <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> section. For more information on setting up alert conditions, please refer the [alert condition documentation](/docs/slerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions).

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set condition threshold to Static [#set-static-thresholds]

    <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT> uses a static thresold. Under the <DNT>**Set condition thresholds**</DNT> section of the <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> page, set a static threshold as follows:
      1. Select <DNT>**Static**</DNT>.
      2. Select severity level for the alert condition.
      3. Set the threshold value.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add future behavior prediction [#predict-future-behavior]
    1. Under <DNT>**Set condition thresholds**</DNT> section, enable the <DNT>**Predict future behavior**</DNT> toggle.
    2. Set a look-ahead time for the predictive threshold. This is how far you want to look into the future to predict and check for a threshold breach.
        * **Minimum look-ahead time**: Two times the [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration). For example, a 10 minute window duration, the minimum look-ahead time would be 20 minutes.
        * **Maximum look-ahead time**: 360 times the [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration). For example, a 10 minute window duration, the maximum look-ahead time would be 3660 minutes, or approximately 2.5 days.    
        
    3. Set the behavior for the predicted alert event when the actual signal breaches the threshold.
        * Close predicted alert event and open an actual alert event (recommended).
        * Continue to keep the predicted alert event open.

<Callout variant="tip">
  By selecting <DNT>**Close predicted alert event and open one for the occurring event.**</DNT>, you can distinguish between predicted and actual alert events.

  </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Save conditions [#save-conditions]
    Refer [Add alert condition details](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#add-details) to complete the alert condition setup, and then save it.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Post-promotion behavior  [#post-promotion-behavior]
As the Predictive capability feature is in public preview, it is available for a limited promotion period. After this period ends, the following changes occur in alerts:
* Predictive alert events are no longer available in the UI.
* Alert conditions are re-registered with only the static portion of the threshold. This re-registration resets the aggregation window, potentially delaying alert detection if a condition's threshold is breached during the process.
