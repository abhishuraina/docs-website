<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

While most alerts inform you after an event has happened, <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> help you to detect problems before they happen. This is done in a manner similar to [static threshold](/docs/alerts/create-alert/set-thresholds/set-thresholds-alert-condition) conditions with the difference being that rather than alerting when your signal breaches the threshold, the alert is triggered when the signal is <DNT>**predicted**</DNT> to breach the threshold. Using your historical data, we fit a predictive model to your signal. With each incoming data point, a prediction is made of up to 360 steps into the future (a step is equal to the signal's [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration)). If any of the predicted data points breaches your static threshold with the settings specified when you set up the condition, an alert will be triggered. By being alerted before a problem might occur, you will be able to take corrective measure before a potential problem happens.

## Enable <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT>  [#enable-predictive-alerts]
To enable the <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> capability, navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Administration](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal) > Preview & Trials**</DNT>, and enable the <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> feature.

## Use cases [#use-cases]
<DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> are ideal for signals with strong trends or predictable, repeatable patterns. You can leverage the predictive capability of <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> in several situations:

* Golden signal proactive monitoring - As an engineer, you want to be alerted when any of your golden signals, such as throughput, latency, or error rate, start trending toward your set limits. This empowers you to take preemptive measures and ensure your application continues running smoothly.
* Disk capacity forecasting - As a data center manager, you want to receive advance notifications from the alerting system when a disk may soon reach full capacity. This allows you to address resource saturation and prevent downtime by planning capacity upgrades ahead of time.
* Revenue prediction for business impact - As a business strategist, you aim to forecast revenue trends to tackle financial planning challenges. Using the <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> feature, you can make informed decisions that drive business growth.

## Algorithm [#algorithm]
Currently, <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> supports the <DNT>**[Holt-Winters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Triple_exponential_smoothing_(Holt_Winters))**</DNT> algorithm, also known as exponential smoothing, for both seasonal and non-seasonal time series. This standard algorithm is used for forecasting and prediction tasks. When fitting a model to your data, the feature auto-selects seasonal or non-seasonal options based on the behavior of your historical data.

### Seasonal pattern
For seasonal data, hourly, daily, and weekly seasonalities are supported. Monthly and yearly seasonalities are not supported due to computational limitations like data retention and real-time evaluation. To model seasonal patterns, you need historical data three times the season length: 3 hours for hourly, 3 days for daily, and 3 weeks for weekly. <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> determine the season length from your historical data, with maximum allowed seasonality based on your set window duration. The following table summarizes the minimum required window durations for each season length:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        <DNT>
          **Season length**
        </DNT>
      </th>

      <th>
        Minimum required window duration
      </th>

      <th>
        Maximum allowed window duration
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Hourly
      </td>

      <td>
        1 minute
      </td>

      <td>
        less than 1 hour
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Daily
      </td>

      <td>
        2 minutes
      </td>

      <td>
        less than 1 day
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Weekly
      </td>

      <td>
        10 minutes
      </td>

      <td>
        less than 1 week
      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

In addition to the season length, the amount of historical data used to train the predictive model is dependent upon your time series' window duration. The amount of historical data used to train the predictive model is 3660 times the set window duration.

### Non-seasonal pattern
For non-seasonal data, there is no dependency on the window duration. When there is no seasonal pattern in the historical data, the model will select the non-seasonal pattern.

## Setting up a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT>
To set up a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT>, follow the same steps as other [alert conditions](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions) and enable the predictive capability during threshold setup. The following procedure shows how to create a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT> condition by defining your signals through an NRQL query. You can also define your signals by [creating a chart](/docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-an-alert/#create-alert-chart) or using [the guided mode](/docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-an-alert/#create-alert-guided). After defining the signals further steps to create alert condition are same.

<Steps>

  <Step>
   ### Define your signal

      1. To create a new alert condition, from [<DNT>**Alert conditions (policies)**</DNT>](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts-ai/alerts-classic/policies), select <DNT>**New alert condition**</DNT>.
      
      2. To define your alert signal, select <DNT>**Write your own query**</DNT> and compose your NRQL query.  Here is an example query for your reference that will give you the throughput of the `MyAwesomeApp` application.

      <Callout variant="tip">
      You can learn more about how to use NRQL, New Relic's query language, in our [NRQL documentation](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/).
      </Callout>

    ```sql
    SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute)
    FROM Metric
    WHERE appName = 'MyAwesomeApp'
    ```

    3. To preview the chart of your query, click Run.
    4. To save your signal and move to fine-tune it, click Next.

      </tbody>
    </table>
    
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Setting the condition threshold

    1. To create a Predictive Alert, you must set the threshold type to be Static. For information, refer to (Static threshold)(/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#static-threshold).

    2. To implement the predictive capability, enable the Predict future behavior toggle.

    <img
      title="Setting up the condition treshold"
      alt="A screenshot showing the Set condition threshold section of the alert creation menu"
      src="/images/predictive-alert-set-condition-thresholds.webp"
    /> 

    <img
      title="Predict future behavior"
      alt="A screenshot showing the options when enabling the predictive capability"
      src="/images/predictive-alert-predict-future-behavior.webp"
    /> 

    3. The Look-ahead section indicates how far into the future you want your model to predict and use for your alert. Set a look-ahead time for the predictive threshold.
    * Minimum look-ahead time: Two times of the [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration).
    * Maximum look-ahead time: 360 times of the [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration).

    To look further ahead into the future, you can increase the [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration).

    4. Set the predicted alert event behavior when the actual signal breaches the threshold. You can either close the predicted alert and open an actual alert or keep the predicted alert open to reduce noise.

    5. After you finish setting up your condition threshold, click Next.

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Add alert condition details

    Name your Predictive alert condition and attach it to an alert policy. For more details, refer [Alert condition details](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#add-details).

  </Step>

</Steps>

After completing all of the above steps you will have successfully set up an alert condtion with predictive capability.

## Post-Promotion Behavior  [#post-promotion-behavior]
As the <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT> feature is in public preview, it is available for a limited promotion period. After this period ends, the following changes will occur in alerts:
* Predictive alert events are no longer available in the UI.
* Alert conditions are re-registered with only the static portion of the threshold. This re-registration resets the aggregation window, potentially delaying alert detection if a condition's threshold is breached during the process.
