<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy), and is available for a limited promotion period. After this period ends, the following changes will occur:
* Predictive alert events will no longer be available in the UI.
* Alert conditions will be re-registered with only the static portion of the threshold. This re-registration will reset the aggregation window, potentially delaying alert detection if a condition's threshold is breached during the process.
</Callout>

While most alerts inform you after an event has happened, <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> help you to detect problems before they happen. This is done in a manner similar to [static threshold](/docs/alerts/create-alert/set-thresholds/set-thresholds-alert-condition) conditions with the difference being that rather than alerting when your signal breaches the threshold, the alert is triggered when the signal is <DNT>**predicted**</DNT> to breach the threshold. Using your historical data, we fit a predictive model to your signal. With each incoming data point, a prediction is made of up to 360 steps into the future (a step is equal to the signal's [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration)). If any of the predicted data points breaches your static threshold with the settings specified when you set up the condition, an alert will be triggered. By being alerted before a problem might occur, you will be able to take corrective measure before a potential problem happens.

## Enabling <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT>  [#enable-predictive-alerts]
To enable the <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> capability, navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Administration](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal) > Preview & Trials**</DNT>, and enable the <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> feature.

## Use Cases [#use-cases]
<DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> are best suited for signals that have (or could experience) strong trends or predictiable repeatable patterns. Here are some examples of when you can leverage the predictive cabaility of <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT>:

* Golden Signal Proactive Monitoring - As an engineer, I would like to be alerted when any of my golden signals (throughput, latency, error rate) are trending in a bad direction so that I can take preemptive measures to ensure my application continues to run smoothly.
* Disk Capacity Forecasting - As a data center manager, I would like to predict and be notified when a disk is going to fill up in order to solve the problem of resource saturation and thus prevent downtime by planning capacity upgrades in advance.
* Revenue Prediction for Business Impact - As a business strategist, I would like to forecast revenue trends in order to solve the problem of financial planning and thus make informed decisions to drive business growth.

## Algorithm [#algorithm]
Currently, <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> only supports the <DNT>**[Holt-Winters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Triple_exponential_smoothing_(Holt_Winters))**</DNT> algorithm, also known as exponential smoothing, for both seasonal and non-seasonal time series. This is a commonly used and standard algorithm for forecasting and prediction tasks. When fitting a model to your data, we choose either seasonal or non-seasonal based upon the behavior of your historical data. We currently support hourly, daily, and weekly seasonalities. We do not support either monthly or yearly seasonality due to computational limitations, including factors such as data retention, computation, and real-time evaluation. 

In order to model seasonal patterns in your data, we must have at least 3 times the season length worth of data. So in order to properly model seasonal patterns for hourly, daily, and weekly seasonality, we need to have seen at least 3 hours, 3 days, and 3 weeks of data respectively. For <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT>, the season length is determined using your historical data and the maximum allowed seasonality is based on your set [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration). For example, this means that if your data has a weekly seasonal pattern, the minimum window duration that is supported is 10 minutes. The minimum required window durations for each supported season length are summarized in the following table:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        <DNT>
          **Season Length**
        </DNT>
      </th>

      <th>
        Minimum Required Window Duration
      </th>

      <th>
        Maximum Allowed Window Duration
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Hourly
      </td>

      <td>
        1 minute
      </td>

      <td>
        less than 1 hour
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Daily
      </td>

      <td>
        2 minutes
      </td>

      <td>
        less than 1 day
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Weekly
      </td>

      <td>
        10 minutes
      </td>

      <td>
        less than 1 week
      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

In addition to the season length, the amount of historical data used to train the predictive model is dependent upon your time series' window duration. A window duration of 1 minute will result in approximately 2.5 days of historical data being used. A window duration of 10 minutes will result in approximately 25 days of historical data being used.

## Setting up a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT>
In order to demonstrate how to set up a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT>, we'll go through the prcoess step by step with an example. Imagine you have an application with a usually steady throughput and you want to know ahead of time if there is a positive upwards trend in the number of transactions. This is a perfect use case for a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT>. With a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT> you could be alerted when the number of transactions starts trending upward, giving you enough time to make any neccessary updates or changes before things become a problem.

Setting up a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT> follows all of the same steps of setting up any other alert condition with the predictive capability being turned on during the threshold setup. For even more details on setting up alert conditions, please refer to the [documentation](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions). Below is an example demonstrating how to set up your own <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT> condition by writing your own NRQL query. 

<Steps>

  <Step>
   ### Define your signal

    In this example, you want to alert when the number of transactions is starting to trend upwards, which will notify you before the throughput becomes a problem.

    You can use a NRQL query to define the signals you want an alert condition to use as the foundation for your alert. For this example, you will be using this query:

    ```sql
    SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute)
    FROM Metric
    WHERE appName = 'MyAwesomeApp'
    ```

    Using this query for your alert condition tells New Relic you want to know the throughput your `MyAwesomeApp` application. Proactive alerting on throughput, a core golden signal, will allow you to identify problems early before they become big problems.

    You can learn more about how to use NRQL, New Relic's query language, in our [NRQL documentation](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/).

    After clicking on <DNT>**Run**</DNT>, a chart will appear with a preview of your signal.

    <img
      title="Define your signal"
      alt="A screenshot showing the preview of the throughput for `MyAwesomeApp`"
      src="/images/predictive-alert-signal-setup.webp"
    />

    Click on <DNT>**Run**</DNT> in the bottom right of the window to continue to the next step.
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Fine-tune your signal with advanced settings
    
    Here you will be able to fine tune your signal with several advanced configuration options. For our example, you will want to set up the settings like you see in the image below.

    <img
      title="Fine-tune your signal"
      alt="A screenshot showing the the advanced settings for your signal`"
      src="/images/predictive-alert-fine-tune-signal.webp"
    />  

    The advanced settings you can use to fine-tune your signal are:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            <DNT>
              **Advanced Setting**
            </DNT>
          </th>

          <th>
            Description
          </th>

        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Window Duration
          </td>
          <td>
            Defines how your data is grouped, or in other words aggregated, for analysis. This setting is important for <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> since it is used to determine how much data is used to train the predictive model and what the maximum allowed season length can be.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Use sliding window aggregation
          </td>
          <td>
            Helps to smooth out "spiky" signals. This option will incur additional charges if enabled.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Streaming method
          </td>
          <td>
            Controls how your data is collected prior to being evaluated. Select the option that best matches your data.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Delay
          </td>
          <td>
            Sets how long to wait for events that belong in each evaluation window. A longer delay time may increase alert accuracy but delay notifications.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Gap filling strategy
          </td>
          <td>
            Defines how missing data is handled by our analysis. Setting it to <DNT>**None**</DNT> will leave any gaps found in the data. <DNT>**Custom static value**</DNT> will fill the missing data with whatever value you indicate. <DNT>**Last known value**</DNT> will simply use the last observed value to fill in the gaps.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Evaluation delay
          </td>
          <td>
            When toggled on, will allow you to set how long we will wait until we start evaluating the thresholds against your signal.
          </td>
        </tr>

      </tbody>
    </table

    For more details on each of the advanced settings, please consult the [alert condition documentation](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#advanced-signal-settings).

    The most important advanced setting for <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> is the <DNT>**Window duration**</DNT>. As mentioned above, the maximum allowed seasonality for your predictive model is dependent upon your signal's window duration. If you want your predictive model to allow for hourly seasonality, you window duration must be at least 1 minute and less than 60 minutes. For daily, it must be a minimum of 2 minutes and a less than one day. Finally, for weekly, it must be a minimum of 10 minutes and less than one week.
    
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Setting the condition threshold

    In order to create a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT>, you must set the threshold type to be <DNT>**Static**</DNT>. For information on setting up a static threshold, please refer our [alert condition threshold documentation](/docs/alerts/create-alert/set-thresholds/set-thresholds-alert-condition).

    Next you want to toggle on <DNT>**Predict future behavior**</DNT>. This will let your static threshold implement the predictive capability.

    <img
      title="Setting up the condition treshold"
      alt="A screenshot showing the Set condition threshold section of the alert creation menu"
      src="/images/predictive-alert-set-condition-thresholds.webp"
    /> 

    Highlighted in the image above are where you set the threshold type to <DNT>**Static**</DNT> and enable <DNT>**Predict future behavior**</DNT>.

    After you enable the <DNT>**Predict future behavior**</DNT> toggle, a new section will appear that allows you to set the specifics for your alerts future behavior.

    <img
      title="Predict future behavior"
      alt="A screenshot showing the options when enabling the predictive capability"
      src="/images/predictive-alert-predict-future-behavior.webp"
    /> 

    The <DNT>**Look ahead**</DNT> section indicates how far into the future you want your model to predict and use for your alert. The maximum allowed value is 360 times the window duration you set above in the advanced settings during step 2. Additionally, you can set what the behavior will be when the actual signal breaches the threshold. You can either close the predicted alert and open an actual alert or keep the predicted alert open to reduce noise.

    After you finish setting up your condition threshold, click on the <DNT>**Next**</DNT> to continue setting up your new predictive alert condition.

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Add alert condition details

    The final step is to name your condition and attach it to an alert policy. For details on how to do this, please refer to the [Add alert condition details section of our alert condition documentation](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#add-details).

  </Step>

</Steps>

After completing all of the above steps you will have successfully set up an alert condtion with predictive capability.

## Post-Promotion Behavior  [#post-promotion-behavior]
As the <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT> feature is in public preview, it is available for a limited promotion period. After this period ends, the following changes will occur in alerts:
* Predictive alert events are no longer available in the UI.
* Alert conditions are re-registered with only the static portion of the threshold. This re-registration resets the aggregation window, potentially delaying alert detection if a condition's threshold is breached during the process.
