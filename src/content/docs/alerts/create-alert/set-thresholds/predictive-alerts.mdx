<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

<DNT>**Predictive alerts**</DNT> in New Relic use historical data to anticipate when a static threshold is going to be exceeded. This feature creates alerts before actual breaches occur, allowing you to take corrective measures before issues escalate. This helps reduce downtime and improve system reliability. You can configure predictive alerts only for static thresholds and set how far into the future you want to predict, providing flexibility in your alerting strategy. When a predicted value touches the static threshold, a predictive alert event triggers, with the event title prefixed as <DNT>**Prediction: **</DNT> to help you identify it.

To enable predictive alerts, you need to enroll in <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> in New Relic. <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> provides the essential data needed for predictive alerts by using historical data to forecast trends and anticipate when static thresholds might be exceeded. While <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> do not trigger alerts themselves, they supply the data necessary for <DNT>**Predictive alerts**</DNT> to warn of potential issues.

<Callout variant="tip">
  New Relic currently uses the [Holt-Winters model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Triple_exponential_smoothing_(Holt_Winters)) for predicting, which reliably captures seasonal patterns and trends in your data.
</Callout>

To enroll in <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT>, refer to the **Trial & Preview** section.

## Set predictive alert for an alert condition [#set-predictive-alert]
To set or update an alert condition with the predictive alert capability, follow these steps:

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Edit or set up a new alert condition [#create-alert-condition]

    #### To edit an existing alert condition:
    1. Select an alert condition from <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Alert Conditions**</DNT>, and edit the <DNT>**Signal behaviour**</DNT>.
    2. From the <DNT>**Signal behaviour**</DNT> section, click <DNT>**Edit**</DNT>. the <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> section opens.


    
    #### To set up a new alert condition:
    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Alert Conditions**</DNT>.
    2. Click <DNT>**+ New alert condition > Use guided mode**</DNT>. You can also write a NRQL query to create an alert condition.
    3. If you are using the guided mode, follow the on-screen instuctions till you are at the <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> section. If you are writing a NRQL query, run the query to get the data on the chart, and click <DNT>**Next**</DNT> to get to the <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> section.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set static thresholds [#set-static-thresholds]
  1. If you want to fine-tune your signal, in the <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> section, update the following:
      * [Data aggregation](/docs/alerts/create-alert/fine-tune/streaming-alerts-key-terms-concepts/#aggregation-methods)
      * [Gap filling strategy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/create-alert/fine-tune/streaming-alerts-key-terms-concepts/#gap-filling)
  2. To set a static threshold for the alert condition, under <DNT>**Set condition thresholds**</DNT>:
      1. Select <DNT>**Static**</DNT>.
      2. Select severity level for the alert condition.
      3. Set the threshold value.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set predictive alert [#set-predictive-alert]
  
    1. Under <DNT>**Set condition thresholds**</DNT>, enable the <DNT>**Predictive alert**</DNT> toggle.
    2. Set a look ahead time for the predictive alert. This is the time in the future you want to predict the signal.
        * **Minimum look ahead time**: Two times of the [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration).
        * **Maximum look ahead time**: 360 times of the [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration).
    3. Set the predicted alert event behavior, when the actual signal crosses the threshold.
        * Close predicted alert event and open an actual alert event (recommended).
        * Continue to keep the predicted alert event open.

<Callout variant="tip">
  By selecting the <DNT>**Close predicted alert event and open one for the occurring event.**</DNT> option, you can distinguish between predicted and actual alert events.
</Callout>


  </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Save conditions [#save-conditions]
    Refer [Add alert condition details](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#add-details) to complete the alert condition setup, and then save it.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Post-promotion behavior  [#post-promotion-behavior]
As the Predictive Alert feature is in public preview, it is available for a limited promotion period. After this period ends, the following changes occur in Alerts:
* Predictive alert events are no longer available in the UI.
* Alert conditions are re-registered with only the static portion of the threshold. This re-registration resets the aggregation window, potentially delaying alert detection if a condition's threshold is breached during the process.
