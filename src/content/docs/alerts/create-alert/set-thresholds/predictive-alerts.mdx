<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy), and is available for a limited promotion period. After this period ends, the following changes will occur:
* Predictive alert events will no longer be available in the UI.
* Alert conditions will be re-registered with only the static portion of the threshold. This re-registration will reset the aggregation window, potentially delaying alert detection if a condition's threshold is breached during the process.
</Callout>

While most alerts inform you after an event has happened, <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> help you to detect problems before they happen. This is done in a manner similar to [static threshold](/docs/alerts/create-alert/set-thresholds/set-thresholds-alert-condition) conditions with the difference being that rather than alerting when your signal breaches the threshold, the alert is triggered when the signal is <DNT>**predicted**</DNT> to breach the threshold. Using your historical data, we fit a predictive model to your signal. With each incoming data point, a prediction is made of up to 360 steps into the future (a step is equal to the signal's [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration)). If any of the predicted data points breaches your static threshold with the settings specified when you set up the condition, an alert will be triggered. By being alerted before a problem might occur, you will be able to take corrective measure before a potential problem happens.

## Enable <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT>  [#enable-predictive-alerts]
To enable the <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> capability, navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Administration](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal) > Preview & Trials**</DNT>, and enable the <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> feature.

## Use cases [#use-cases]
<DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> are ideal for signals with strong trends or predictable, repeatable patterns. You can leverage the predictive capability of <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> in several situations:

* Golden Signal Proactive Monitoring - As an engineer, you want to be alerted when any of your golden signals, such as throughput, latency, or error rate, start trending strongly indicating a potential problem. This empowers you to take preemptive measures and ensure your application continues running smoothly.
* Disk Capacity Forecasting - As a data center manager, you want to receive advance notifications from the alerting system when a disk may soon reach full capacity. This allows you to address resource saturation and prevent downtime by planning capacity upgrades ahead of time.
* Revenue Prediction for Business Impact - As a business strategist, you aim to forecast revenue trends to tackle financial planning challenges. Using the <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> feature, you can make informed decisions that drive business growth.

## Algorithm [#algorithm]
Currently, <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> currently supports the <DNT>**[Holt-Winters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Triple_exponential_smoothing_(Holt_Winters))**</DNT> algorithm, also known as exponential smoothing, for both seasonal and non-seasonal time series. This standard algorithm is used for forecasting and prediction tasks. When fitting a model to your data, the feature selects seasonal or non-seasonal options based on the behavior of your historical data. Hourly, daily, and weekly seasonalities are supported, but monthly and yearly seasonalities are not due to computational limitations like data retention and real-time evaluation. 

To model seasonal patterns, a minimum requirement of three times the season length in historical data is necessary for each type of seasonality. Three hours of data are needed for hourly seasonality, three days for daily, and three weeks for weekly. <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> determine the season length from your historical data, with maximum allowed seasonality based on your set window duration. For instance, if your data shows a weekly seasonal pattern, the minimum window duration supported is 10 minutes. The following table summarizes the minimum required window durations for each season length:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        <DNT>
          **Season length**
        </DNT>
      </th>

      <th>
        Minimum required window duration
      </th>

      <th>
        Maximum allowed window duration
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Hourly
      </td>

      <td>
        1 minute
      </td>

      <td>
        less than 1 hour
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Daily
      </td>

      <td>
        2 minutes
      </td>

      <td>
        less than 1 day
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Weekly
      </td>

      <td>
        10 minutes
      </td>

      <td>
        less than 1 week
      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

In addition to the season length, the amount of historical data used to train the predictive model is dependent upon your time series' window duration. A window duration of 1 minute will result in approximately 2.5 days of historical data being used. A window duration of 10 minutes will result in approximately 25 days of historical data being used.

## Setting up a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT>
To demonstrate how to set up a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT>, let's go through the process step by step using an example. Imagine you have an application with usually steady throughput, and you're eager to know beforehand if there's an upward trend in transactions. This scenario is ideal for a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT>. With a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT>, you'll be notified when transactions start trending upward, providing you enough time to implement necessary updates or changes before issues arise.

Setting up a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT> requires the same steps as setting up any other alert condition. You enable the predictive capability during the threshold setup. For additional details on setting up alert conditions, refer to the [documentation](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions). The following example demonstrates how to set up <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT> condition by writing your NRQL query.

<Steps>

  <Step>
   ### Define your signal

    In this example, you want an alert notification when the number of transactions starts trending upward. This notification will arrive before throughput becomes an issue.

    You can use a NRQL query to define the signals you want an alert condition to use as the foundation for your alert. For this example, you will be using this query:

    ```sql
    SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute)
    FROM Metric
    WHERE appName = 'MyAwesomeApp'
    ```

    Using this query for your alert condition tells New Relic you want to know the throughput your `MyAwesomeApp` application. Proactive alerting on throughput, a core golden signal, will allow you to identify problems early before they become big problems.

    You can learn more about how to use NRQL, New Relic's query language, in our [NRQL documentation](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/).

    After clicking on <DNT>**Run**</DNT>, a chart will appear with a preview of your signal.

    <img
      title="Define your signal"
      alt="A screenshot showing the preview of the throughput for `MyAwesomeApp`"
      src="/images/predictive-alert-signal-setup.webp"
    />

    Click on <DNT>**Run**</DNT> in the bottom right of the window to continue to the next step.
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Fine-tune your signal with advanced settings
    
    Here you will be able to fine tune your signal with several advanced configuration options. For our example, you will want to set up the settings like you see in the image below.

    <img
      title="Fine-tune your signal"
      alt="A screenshot showing the the advanced settings for your signal`"
      src="/images/predictive-alert-fine-tune-signal.webp"
    />  

    The advanced settings you can use to fine-tune your signal are:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            <DNT>
              **Advanced Setting**
            </DNT>
          </th>

          <th>
            Description
          </th>

        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Window Duration
          </td>
          <td>
            Defines how your data is grouped, or in other words aggregated, for analysis. This setting is important for <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> since it is used to determine how much data is used to train the predictive model and what the maximum allowed season length can be.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Use sliding window aggregation
          </td>
          <td>
            Helps to smooth out "spiky" signals. This option will incur additional charges if enabled.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Streaming method
          </td>
          <td>
            Controls how your data is collected prior to being evaluated. Select the option that best matches your data.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Delay
          </td>
          <td>
            Sets how long to wait for events that belong in each evaluation window. A longer delay time may increase alert accuracy but delay notifications.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Gap filling strategy
          </td>
          <td>
            Defines how missing data is handled by our analysis. Setting it to <DNT>**None**</DNT> will leave any gaps found in the data. <DNT>**Custom static value**</DNT> will fill the missing data with whatever value you indicate. <DNT>**Last known value**</DNT> will simply use the last observed value to fill in the gaps.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Evaluation delay
          </td>
          <td>
            When toggled on, will allow you to set how long we will wait until we start evaluating the thresholds against your signal.
          </td>
        </tr>

      </tbody>
    </table>

    For more details on each of the advanced settings, please consult the [alert condition documentation](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#advanced-signal-settings).

    The most important advanced setting for <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> is the <DNT>**Window duration**</DNT>. As mentioned above, the maximum allowed seasonality for your predictive model is dependent upon your signal's window duration. If you want your predictive model to allow for hourly seasonality, you window duration must be at least 1 minute and less than 60 minutes. For daily, it must be a minimum of 2 minutes and a less than one day. Finally, for weekly, it must be a minimum of 10 minutes and less than one week.
    
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Setting the condition threshold

    In order to create a <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT>, you must set the threshold type to be <DNT>**Static**</DNT>. For information on setting up a static threshold, please refer our [alert condition threshold documentation](/docs/alerts/create-alert/set-thresholds/set-thresholds-alert-condition).

    Next you want to toggle on <DNT>**Predict future behavior**</DNT>. This will let your static threshold implement the predictive capability.

    <img
      title="Setting up the condition treshold"
      alt="A screenshot showing the Set condition threshold section of the alert creation menu"
      src="/images/predictive-alert-set-condition-thresholds.webp"
    /> 

    Highlighted in the image above are where you set the threshold type to <DNT>**Static**</DNT> and enable <DNT>**Predict future behavior**</DNT>.

    After you enable the <DNT>**Predict future behavior**</DNT> toggle, a new section will appear that allows you to set the specifics for your alerts future behavior.

    <img
      title="Predict future behavior"
      alt="A screenshot showing the options when enabling the predictive capability"
      src="/images/predictive-alert-predict-future-behavior.webp"
    /> 

    The <DNT>**Look ahead**</DNT> section indicates how far into the future you want your model to predict and use for your alert. The maximum allowed value is 360 times the window duration you set above in the advanced settings during step 2. Additionally, you can set what the behavior will be when the actual signal breaches the threshold. You can either close the predicted alert and open an actual alert or keep the predicted alert open to reduce noise.

    After you finish setting up your condition threshold, click on the <DNT>**Next**</DNT> to continue setting up your new predictive alert condition.

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Add alert condition details

    The final step is to name your condition and attach it to an alert policy. For details on how to do this, please refer to the [Add alert condition details section of our alert condition documentation](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#add-details).

  </Step>

</Steps>

After completing all of the above steps you will have successfully set up an alert condtion with predictive capability.

## Post-Promotion Behavior  [#post-promotion-behavior]
As the <DNT>**Predictive Alert**</DNT> feature is in public preview, it is available for a limited promotion period. After this period ends, the following changes will occur in alerts:
* Predictive alert events are no longer available in the UI.
* Alert conditions are re-registered with only the static portion of the threshold. This re-registration resets the aggregation window, potentially delaying alert detection if a condition's threshold is breached during the process.
