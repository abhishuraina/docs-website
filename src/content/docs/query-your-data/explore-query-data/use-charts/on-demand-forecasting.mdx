  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>



Forecasting in New Relic involves using historical data to predict future trends and potential performance issues. 
By analyzing historical data, forecasting provides insights into how these metrics might behave in the future. 
This proactive approach helps you anticipate issues before they occur, enabling timely interventions to maintain optimal system performance. 
Forecasting is a powerful tool for decision-making, helping teams to allocate resources effectively and plan for potential challenges.

<Callout variant="tip">
  New Relic currently uses the [Holt-Winters model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Triple_exponential_smoothing_(Holt_Winters)) for forecasting, which reliably captures seasonal patterns and trends in your data.

## Create a forecast [#create-forecast]
Follow these steps to create a forecast on a line or area chart in New Relic:

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Access a line or area chart [#access-a-line-chart]

    1. Go to [one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities).
    2. Choose a line or area chart from <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT>, or open it from <DNT>**Metrics and events**</DNT>.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Make a forecast [#make-a-forecast]

  In the upper-right corner of the chart, select <DNT>**Make a forecast**</DNT> from the <DNT>**Options**</DNT> menu. 
  The forecasted chart opens in <DNT>**Data explorer**</DNT>. 
  The forecast range is automatically set to 20% of the query window, and highlighted in gray. The graph appears in dotted lines within the forecast range. 

  The chart query is pre-populated with the `FORECAST` function. you can [refine the query](/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-forecast) according to your requirements and run it to get the updated graph.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add to dashboard [#add-to-dashboard]

    1. Click <DNT>**Add to dashboard**</DNT>.
    2. Enter a widget name.
    3. Select a dashboard in which you want to add the widget, or create a new dashboard for it.

    You can now view the forecasted chart on the selected dashboard.

  </Step>
  
</Steps>

## Default forecasting range [#default-forecasting-range]
The default forecast range in New Relic provides a baseline for projecting future trends based on historical data. 
This range is automatically set to ensure users receive meaningful insights without a manual NRQL configuration. 
Understanding these default settings helps users make informed decisions about when and how to customize their forecasts for more precise predictions.

### Default values [#default-values]
When you create a forecast in New Relic, the system automatically appends the `FORECAST` function to the existing chart query and sets the following default behaviour:
* **Forecast range**: Projects 20% of the total time specified in your query window, allowing you to see a short-term projection based on current trends.
* **Historical data**: Utilizes two query windows into the past as historical data for analyzing trends and patterns, and generating forecasts.
* **Time interval**: Matches the data point interval of the forecast to the query window, ensuring consistency in data projection.

Example:

```sql
FROM NrAiIncidentDebug SELECT count(*) WHERE environment LIKE 'production'
TIMESERIES 1 hour FACET event SINCE 1 day ago FORECAST
```
The forecasted chart appears as following:

## Customize the forecasting range [#customize-forecasting-range]
You can customize a chart forecast by editing the NRQL query to adjust the projection range and refine the accuracy according to your needs. 
To get familiar with NRQL, see [NRQL documentation](/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language). 

Use the following keywords to refine a forecast:
* **`BY <a time range>`**: Project the forecast up to the specified time range.
* **`USING <a historical data span>`**: Analyze historical data from the defined span to project the forecast.

Example:

```sql
FROM NrAiIncidentDebug SELECT count(*) WHERE environment LIKE 'production'
TIMESERIES 1 hour FACET event SINCE 1 day ago FORECAST BY 1 day USING 30 days
```

The refined forecast of the chart appears as following:
