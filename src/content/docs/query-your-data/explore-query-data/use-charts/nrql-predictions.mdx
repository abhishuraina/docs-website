<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

<DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> in New Relic uses historical data to predict future trends, providing insights into how metrics might behave in the future. This proactive approach helps you visualize trends and anticipate potential issues, enabling timely interventions to maintain optimal system performance. While <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> itself does not identify potential issues, it equips you with the information needed to assess trends and plan for future challenges.


For automatic identification of potential issues, you can enroll for the <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> feature, currently available in public preview. <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> work alongside <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> to automatically trigger alerts when projected trends indicate a potential issue, allowing for proactive management of your systems.

<Callout variant="tip">
  New Relic currently uses the [Holt-Winters model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Triple_exponential_smoothing_(Holt_Winters)) for predicting, which supports hourly, daily, and weekly seasonal patterns and trends in your data.
</Callout>

The <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> feature is available only to the **[Advanced Compute](https://newrelic.com/pricing/compute#pricing_plan-compute)** customers. To enroll, navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Administration](https://one.newrelic.com//admin-portal) > Preview & Trails**</DNT>, and enable <DNT>**NRQL predictions**</DNT>.

## Add prediction on a line or area chart [#add-prediction]
To add prediction on a line or area chart, follow these steps:

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Access a line or area chart [#access-a-chart]

    1. Go to [one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities).
    2. To add prediction to a line or area chart, select it from <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT>, or open it from <DNT>**Metrics and events**</DNT>.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add prediction [#add-prediction]

  To add prediction, from the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu, select <DNT>**Predict trend**</DNT>  
  In **Data Explorer**, The prediction trend appears on the chart, projecting future trends. The prediction range is automatically set to 20% of the query window, and highlighted in gray. The graph appears in dotted lines within the predicted range. 

  The chart query populates with the `PREDICT` function. You can [refine the query](/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-prediction) according to your requirements and run it to get the updated trend.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add to dashboard [#add-to-dashboard]

    1. To add the chart with prediction to a dashboard, click <DNT>**Add to dashboard**</DNT>.
    2. Enter a widget name.
    3. Select a dashboard in which you want to add the widget, or create a new dashboard for it.

    You can now view the chart with prediction on the selected dashboard.

  </Step>
  
</Steps>

## Default prediction range [#default-prediction-range]
When you add a prediction to a chart, the `PREDICT` function appends to the existing chart query with the following default behaviors.
* **Prediction range**: Projects 20% of the total time specified in your query window, allowing you to see a short-term projection based on current trends.
* **Historical data**: Processes historical data from the current query window and the two preceding ones to generate predictions.
* **Time interval**: Matches the data point interval of the prediction on the query window, ensuring consistency in data projection.

Example:

```sql
FROM NrAiIncidentDebug SELECT count(*) WHERE environment LIKE 'production'
TIMESERIES 1 hour FACET event SINCE 1 day ago PREDICT
```
The default prediction on the chart appears as follows:

   />

    <figcaption>
  <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > dashboards**</DNT>: default prediction.

## Customize the prediction range [#customize-prediction-range]
You can customize the prediction by adding the projection range and historical data span in the chart query. 
To get familiar with NRQL, refer to [NRQL documentation](/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language). 

Use the following keywords to refine a prediction:
* **`BY <time range>`**: Project the prediction up to the specified time range.
* **`USING <time range>`**: Process historical data from the defined time range to project the prediction.

Example:

```sql
FROM NrAiIncidentDebug SELECT count(*) WHERE environment LIKE 'production'
TIMESERIES 1 hour FACET event SINCE 1 day ago PREDICT BY 1 day USING 30 days
```

The refined prediction on the chart appears as follows:

   <img
     title="Refined prediction"

   />
