## Enrollment [#enrollment]
To enroll for the <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> feature, navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Administration](https://one.newrelic.com//admin-portal) > Preview & Trials**</DNT>, and enable <DNT>**NRQL predictions**</DNT>.

## Add prediction on a line or area chart [#add-prediction]
Adding a prediction to a chart can be accomplished using either the <DNT>**Predict trend**</DNT> function added to all charts or by editing the NRQL query directly by using the `PREDICT` clause. The prediction will be indicated by a dashed line and a
grey area on the chart.

### Steps to add a prediction directly to an existing chart:
<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Access a line or area chart [#access-a-chart]

    1. Go to [one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities).
    2. To add prediction to a line or area chart, select it from <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT>, or open it from <DNT>**Metrics and events**</DNT>.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add prediction [#add-prediction]

  To add prediction, from the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu, select <DNT>**Predict trend**</DNT>. In **Data Explorer**, the prediction trend appears on the chart, projecting future trends. The prediction range is automatically set to 20% of the query window, and highlighted in gray. The graph appears in dotted lines within the predicted range. 

  The `PREDICT` keyword is appended to the chart query. You can [refine the query](#customize-prediction-range) according to your requirements and run it to get the updated trend.

  <Callout variant="tip">
 When you add prediction to an area chart, the chart type changes to a line chart with prediction.
  </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add to dashboard [#add-to-dashboard]

    1. To add the chart with prediction to a dashboard, click <DNT>**Add to dashboard**</DNT>.
    2. Enter a widget name.
    3. Select a dashboard in which you want to add the widget, or create a new dashboard for it.

    You can now view the chart with prediction on the selected dashboard.

  </Step>
  
</Steps>

### Using the `PREDICT` clause in a NRQL query
Simply append your time series query with the `PREDICT` clause to add a prediction to your query that uses the default settings. For more information, please refer to the [NRQL syntax documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/##sel-prediction).

## Supported Prediction Algorithms[#supported-algorithms]
Currently, NRQL predictions only supports the Holt-Winters algorithm for both seasonal and non-seasonal time series. Holt-Winters is a commonly used and standard algorithm used for forecasting and prediction tasks. Seasonal lengths of 
hourly, daily, and weekly are supported. 

## Default behavior[#defaults]
When you add a prediction to a chart, the `PREDICT` function appends to the existing chart query with the following default behaviors:
* **Seasonality**: Automatically detects and identifies if the data exhibits any seasonality.
* **Prediction window**: Projects 20% of the total time span specified in your query window.
* **Historical data for training**: Uses historical data from the current query window and the two preceding ones to generate predictions.
* **Time interval**: Aligns with the data point interval of the time series in the query window to ensure consistency in data projection.

Example NRQL and chart using `PREDICT`:

```sql
FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT
```
The default prediction on the chart appears as follows:

## Customize the predictive model [#customize-prediction-range]
You can customize the prediction in the following ways. To get familiar with NRQL, refer to [NRQL documentation](/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language).

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="hyperparameters" title="Customize the query using model hyperparameters">
 As <DNT>**Holt-Winters**</DNT> is the only prediction algorithm we support currently, you can fine tune the prediction model to your use case by adjusting the hyperparameters by adding `holtwinters(...)` after the `PREDICT` clause.
 
 The following hyperparameters are supported for the Holt-Winters model:

 <table id="hyperparameters">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colSpan={2}>
        <DNT>
          **Hyperparameters**
        </DNT>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        `seasonality`
      </td>

      <td>
        Indicates the seasonal behavior to be used for the predictions. There are three supported options:
        * **`seasonality: <season length>`**: Sets the seasonality of the time series to a known season length. Must use `integer units` for the amount of time.
        * **`seasonality: AUTO`**: Automatically detects the seasonality of the time series.
        * **`seasonality: NONE`**: Disables seasonality and instead generates a non-seasonal prediction.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `alpha`
      </td>

      <td>
        Sets the level smoothing factor. Allowed values are 0 {'<='} `alpha` {'<='} 1.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `beta`
      </td>

      <td>
        Sets the trend smoothing factor. Allowed values are 0 {'<='} `beta` {'<='} 1.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `gamma`
      </td>

      <td>
        Sets the season smoothing factor. Allowed values are 0 {'<='} `gamma` {'<='} 1.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `phi`
      </td>

      <td>
        Sets the trend damping parameter. Recommended values are 0.98 {'<='} `phi` {'<='} 1.
      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

Higher values for `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma` indicate more weight on recent data, while lower values give more weight to historical data. For the damping parameter, lower values of `phi` indicate more damping to the predictions (i.e. the predictions will eventually level out to a flat curve),
whereas values of `phi` approaching 1 will minimize the effect of the damping.
</Collapser>

<Collapser id="prediction-range" title="Customize how far into the future to predict">
Use the `BY` keyword to set how far ahead in time you want the model to predict. For example, `PREDICT BY 3 hours` will generate a prediction 3 hours into the future from the latest point in the time series. Must use `integer units` for the 
      amount of time.
</Collapser>

<Collapser id="historical-data-range" title="Customize the query by processing historical data for a specified time range">
Use the `USING` keyword to specify how much historical data is to be used to train the model. For example, `PREDICT USING 1 day` will use the query window plus 1 days worth of history to train the model. Must use `integer units` for the 
      amount of time.
 
</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Example of using hyperparameters and the `BY` and `USING` keywords:

```sql
FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT holtwinters(seasonality: AUTO, alpha: 0.2) BY 1 hour USING 2 hours
```

This query specifies that the seasonality will be set to automatic detection and `alpha` will be set to `0.2`. Predictions will be made 1 hour out into the future and the model will be trained using the query window length plus 2 hours of historic data.
The customized prediction on the chart appears as follows:
