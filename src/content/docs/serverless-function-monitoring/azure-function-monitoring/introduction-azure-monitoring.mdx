New Relic's instrumentation for Azure Functions offers deep visibility into the inner workings of your functions. By adding the New Relic agent to your function, each invocation is monitored by New Relic. This enables you to track the duration of function invocations, monitor errors, see distributed tracing, and record details about the source events and your function's responses.


<Callout variant="important">

For Azure Functions, the agent reports data such as distributed traces and logs, which are available under 'Services - APM' as an APM entity. However, a separate entity (provided by infrastructure monitoring) for Azure Functions still exists.

## How you can configure Azure Functions monitoring?

You can configure Azure Functions monitoring for different environments and various combination of runtimes and deployment methods. The following sections provide instructions for configuring Azure Functions monitoring for the following environments:

1. You meet the [compatibility and requirements](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/azure-function-monitoring/compatibility-requirement-azure-monitoring) for Azure Functions monitoring.
2. Link your [Azure account to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-functions-monitoring-integration/).
3. Instrument your Azure Function with the New Relic for your environment:
   * [Linux](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/azure-function-monitoring/linux-instrumentation)
   * [Windows](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/azure-function-monitoring/windows-instrumentation)
   * [Containerized Functions](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/azure-function-monitoring/containerized-instrumentation)
4. Configure the [environment variables](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/azure-function-monitoring/env-variables-azure/) for your Azure Function.
