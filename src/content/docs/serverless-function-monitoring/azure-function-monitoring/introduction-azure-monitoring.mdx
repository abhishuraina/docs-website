If you use Azure Functions to build scalable, event-driven applications, and you want to have a comprehensive visibility into your application performance and operational health. New Relic provides this insight by enabling direct instrumentation of your Azure Function runtimes with minimal code changes for runtimes such as, Node.js, Python, and .NET. This approach allows you to seamlessly monitor your Azure Function executions within the New Relic platform.

Azure Functions operate in a dynamic, serverless environment where resources scale on demand and execution contexts are typically short-lived. In this setting, gaining deep, real-time insights into each function invocation is crucial. New Relic's integration for Azure Functions is specifically designed to meet this need. It moves beyond basic platform-level metrics to provide rich, application-aware telemetry by instrumenting your function code directly. This capability allows you to:

* Track precise execution durations to identify performance bottlenecks.
* Pinpoint errors quickly using detailed stack traces.
* Visualize distributed traces as requests flow through your functions and connected services.
* Record specific details of triggering events and function responses for complete operational context.

By incorporating New Relic's instrumentation into your function's deployment package, you can simplify the process of achieving in-depth observability. This empowers you to effectively manage, troubleshoot, and optimize your serverless applications on Azure.

For Azure Functions, the agent reports data such as distributed traces and logs, which are available under 'Services - APM' as an APM entity. However, a separate entity (provided by infrastructure monitoring) for Azure Functions still exists.

## How you can configure Azure Functions monitoring?

To monitor your Azure Functions with New Relic, you can configure instrumentation across different environments, runtimes, and deployment methods. The following steps guide you through the configuration process:

<Steps>

<Step>
### Compatibility and requirements [#req]
Ensure that your Azure Function meets our [compatibility and requirements](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/azure-function-monitoring/compatibility-requirement-azure-monitoring).
</Step>

<Step>
### Link your Azure account to New Relic [#link]

Link your Azure account to New Relic by configuring polling for Azure Monitor metrics. This enables you to view these metrics in the New Relic UI. For more information, refer [Azure integration](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-functions-monitoring-integration/#polling).
</Step>

<Step>
### Instrument your Azure Function [#instrument]

Depending on your deployment environment, select one of the following options to instrument your Azure Function App with New Relic.

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure environment variables [#env-variables]

After you've instrumented your Azure Function with the New Relic, [configure environment variables](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/azure-function-monitoring/env-variables-azure) for your runtime environment.
</Step>

<Step>

### Restart your Azure Function [#restart]

After you've added the environment variables, restart your Azure Function to apply the changes.
</Step>

</Steps>
