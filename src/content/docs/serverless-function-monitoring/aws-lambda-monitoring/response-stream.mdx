You can monitor AWS Lambda functions that utilize [response streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-response-streaming/) in Node.js applications to gain real-time insights into performance and behavior of each invocation. This solution integrated with [AI monitoring](/docs/ai-monitoring/intro-to-ai-monitoring/) allows you to dig into model's response and capture LLM observability data of the AI workloads related to your response streaming Lambda functions.

This document helps you to:

* Set up Lambda response streaming monitoring.
* Understand the metrics and data available for monitoring Lambda response streaming.
* Learn how to use the New Relic UI to monitor and observe the performance of your Lambda response streaming.

## Integrate the Lambda response streaming

### Prerequisites [#prerequisites]


* Check that your Lambda function meets our [compatibility and requirements](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/compatibility-requirement-lambda-monitoring).


### Configure the Lambda response streaming [#configure-response-streaming]

To enable response streaming monitoring for your Node.js Lambda functions:

1. Install and configure [Lambda monitoring on New Relic](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/compatibility-requirement-lambda-monitoring).

2. Add the required [environment variables](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/env-variables-lambda) for node.js response streaming Lambda functions.

3. Save the changes and deploy the function.

    After deployment, you can view the Lambda response streaming data in the New Relic platform. For more information, See [View the Lambda response streaming data](#view-response-streaming-data).


## Access the Lambda response streaming data [#access-ui]

To view the Lambda response streaming data in the New Relic platform:

1. Log in to your New Relic account.
2. Go to the **left navigation pane > All Capabilities > Serverless Functions**.
3. Select the required Lambda function that utilizes response streaming.
4. In the **More views** section, click **AI Responses**.

    To know more about AI responses, see [view AI responses](/docs/ai-monitoring/explore-ai-data/view-ai-responses).

## Key metrics on the AI Responses page [#key-metrics]

On the **AI Responses** page, monitor the following metrics related to AI responses:

* **Streamed Outbound Bytes:** Displays the average number of bytes streamed out by the Lambda function.
* **Streamed Outbound Throughput:** Displays the average rate at which bytes are streamed out by the Lambda function.
