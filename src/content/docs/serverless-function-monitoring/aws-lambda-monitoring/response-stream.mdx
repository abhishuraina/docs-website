Questions to PM:

1. This is an Limited Preview release or PP or GA release?
2. Does the legal review required?
3. New gif for the UI.
4. Will this feature be display to all the customer or any specific pricing plan customers, like advance compute or advance-core compute?

Integrate your AWS [Lambda response streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-response-streaming/) in the New Relic platform to monitor AWS Lambda functions that utilize response streaming within the Node.js runtime applications. This integration allows you to gain real-time insights into the performance and behavior of your serverless applications that has AI workloads.



## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

* A New Relic account with either an [admin role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users/) or have the Infrastructure manager [add-on role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users/).
* Check that your Lambda function meets our [compatibility and requirements](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/compatibility-requirement-lambda-monitoring).
* Install and configure [Lambda monitoring on New Relic](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/compatibility-requirement-lambda-monitoring).


## Integrate Lambda response streaming [#integrate-response-streaming]

To enable response streaming monitoring for your Node.js Lambda functions:

1. Add the following [environment variable](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/env-variables-lambda) to the required Lambda function for New Relic Lambda response streaming monitoring:

    ```bash
    NEW_RELIC_MACHINE_LEARNING_ENABLED=true
    NEW_RELIC_ML_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_ENABLED=true
    NEW_RELIC_AI_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
    ```
2. Save the changes and deploy the function.

    After deployment, you can view the Lambda response streaming data in the New Relic platform. For more information, See (View the Lambda response streaming data)[#view-response-streaming-data].


## View and use the Lambda response streaming data [#view-response-streaming-data]

To view the Lambda response streaming data in the New Relic platform:

1. Log in to your New Relic account.
2. Go to the **left navigation pane > All Capabilities > Serverless Functions**.
3. Select the required Lambda function that utilizes response streaming.
4. Click **AI Responses** in the **More views** section.

    On the **AI Responses** page, monitor the following metrics related to AI responses:
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Metric</th>

                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Total response</td>
                    <td>Displays the total number of responses generated by the Lambda function.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Response time</td>
                    <td>Displays the time taken for the Lambda function to generate and stream the response.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Token usage per response</td>
                    <td>Displays the number of tokens processed per response.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Errors</td>
                    <td>Lists any errors encountered during the response streaming process.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Number of calls to LLMs</td>
                    <td>Tracks how many times the Lambda function interacts with LLMs to offer insight into usage patterns.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Average tokens per response</td>
                    <td>Provides the average number of tokens processed in each response to understand data volume.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Positive and negative feedback</td>
                    <td>Displays the user feedback sentiment to assess AI response quality.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Responses with feedback</td>
                    <td>Counts responses that have received user feedback for qualitative analysis.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Average token rate in seconds</td>
                    <td>Displays the rate at which tokens are processed to offer insight into processing speed.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
