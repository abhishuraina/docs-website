Service Architecture Intelligence provides a centralized view of your organization's services and operations. It enhances productivity by offering tools for effective resource management, operational optimization, and compliance assurance. The Service Architecure Intelligence has integrates various capabilities, including team management, system observability, performance evaluation, and infrastructure visualization, to streamline processes and improve collaboration across teams.

## Capabilities

The Service Architecture Intelligence offers the following capabilities:

- Teams: New Relic Teams connects the entities you monitor to the teams that own them. This feature allows you to create or import teams into the New Relic platform, assign entities to teams, and manage team-related tasks efficiently. For more information, see [Team](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/teams/teams).

- Catalog: New Relic Catalog offers a single-pane view to enhance the observability and management of software systems in your organization. By providing a unified view of system entities, it facilitates informed decision-making, streamlines operations, and improves collaboration across teams. For more information, see [Catalog](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/catalogs/catalogs).

    - Repository Catalog: The Repository Catalog centralizes and streamlines the management of repositories within an organization. It breaks down silos between teams and enhances cross-team collaboration, enabling stakeholders to efficiently identify existing repositories, understand their purpose, and determine ownership or status. For more information, see [Repository Catalog](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/catalogs/catalogs).

- Scorecards: New Relic Scorecards evaluate team or group performance against predefined rules and custom metrics. They provide a standardized and structured approach to software development, helping organizations adhere to a well-defined engineering strategy. For more information, see [Scorecards](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/getting-started).

- Advanced Maps: The new map experience provides a unified and integrated view of your cloud estate, allowing seamless navigation and exploration of services and infrastructure. It integrates tracing, infrastructure, and performance data into a cohesive experience, addressing limitations of the previous service map. For more information, see [Maps](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/maps/advanced-maps).
