<Callout title="preview">
   We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

   This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>


A Scorecard serves as a container for various rules that collectively assess adherence to defined standards. Scorecards use rules to monitor compliance across different entities and teams, identify areas for improvement, and ensure alignment with both internal and external requirements. This document provides instruction on how to create and manage Scorecards and its rules in New Relic.


## Create a new Scorecard [#create-scorecard]

You can create a Scorecard using one of available templates or your own Scorecards and add their rules to meet your requirements.
For more information, refer:
- [Create a scorecard using Template](#create-scorecard-using-templates)
- [Create a custom scorecard](#create-custom-scorecard)

<Callout variant="tip" title="tip" >
Use NerdGraph mutations to create or manage your Scorecards. For more information, refer [Scorecards tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-scorecards-tutorial.mdx).
</Callout>

**Prerequisites:**

- An active New Relic account ID to create this Scorecard.
- You must be the Organization Admin or part of a custom role to manage Scorecards. For more information to create Scorecards custom role, refer [Custom role for Scorecards](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-scorecards-custom-tutorial).


### Create a Scorecard using templates [#create-scorecard-using-templates]

**To create a scorecard using templates:**

1. Log in to your New Relic account.
2. Go to **left navigation pane > All Capabilities > Scorecards > Create Scorecard**.
2. On the **Create a Scorecard** screen, click **Use a template**.
3. On the **Choose a template** screen, select a scorecard template from the list, and click **Next**.
4. On the **Manage the rules** screen:
   - Enable the required rules.
   - From the **Run this rule in** drop-down list, select the accounts to run this rule.
   - Click **Next**.
5. On the **Review your scorecard details** screen, if required, update the name and description for the scorecard. 
   - Click **Confirm & Create**.
6. After the scorecard is created, you can also add additional rules as required. For more information, refer to [Create Scorecard rule](#create-scorecard-rules).

### Create a custom Scorecard [#create-custom-scorecard]

**To create your own Scorecard:**

1. Log in to your New Relic account.
2. Go to **left navigation pane > All Capabilities > Scorecards > Create Scorecard**.
3. On the **Create a Scorecard** screen, click **Build your own**.
4. Provide a name and description, then click **Create**.
5. After the Scorecard is created, add and configure rules to define your specific compliance criteria. For more information, refer to [Create Scorecard rule](#create-rules).

## Create a Scorecard rule [#create-rules]

Rules in Scorecards are used to evaluate entities against specific compliance criteria. You can define rules to automate the process of validating whether your services, applications, or other resources adhere to the specific requirements.

You can create rules for Scorecards using NRQL queries. Each rule can span multiple entities and validate whether each entity meets specific conditions by evaluating to either true or false. 


**Prerequisites:**

- You must have an active New Relic account ID to create this rule.
- You have a Scorecard created. For more information, refer to [Create a new scorecard](#create-scorecard).
- You must be the Organization Admin or part of a custom role to manage Scorecards. For more information to create Scorecards custom role, refer [Custom role for Scorecards](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-scorecards-custom-tutorial).

Use NerdGraph mutations to create or manage your Scorecards rules. For more information, refer [Scorecards tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-scorecards-tutorial.mdx).
</Callout>

**To create a rule:**

1. Log in to your New Relic account.
2. Go to **left navigation pane > All Capabilities > Scorecards**.
2. Select the required Scorecard.
3. Click **+ Create Rule**.
4. Select the New Relic accounts where the rule will be evaluated. This ensures that the rule applies to the correct set of data and entities. 
5. Enter an NRQL query that specifies your conditions. Your query must contain these two fields:

   * A `FACET` by `entityGUID` for example: `FACET id` as `entityGuid`
   * A score column to evaluate scores for `0` or `1`. For example, `SELECT if(latest(reporting), 1, 0) as 'score'`. 

      Example NRQL:

      ```sql
      SELECT latest(if(tags.language = 'ruby', 0, 1)) as 'score' 
      FROM Entity 
      WHERE tags.environment = 'production' and type = 'APM-APPLICATION' 
      SINCE 1 day ago 
      FACET id, tags.nr.team as 'team'
      ```
6. To validate your query, click Run this query. Upon successful run, a preview response appears.

   <callout variant="tip" title="tip" >
   From the Use existing query drop-down list, select your previously created query to run in the rule.
   </callout>

7. Click **Next**.
8. Provide a name and description for the rule.
9. Click **Save and create**.



## Update a Scorecard [#update-scorecard]

You can update your existing Scorecard, duplicate the Scorecard, or delete an existing Scorecard using the more option.

**To update a scorecard:**

1. Log in to your New Relic account.
