## Create a new Scorecard

You can create a Scorecard using one of the available templates or your own Scorecards and add their rules to meet your requirements. 
For more information, refer to:
- [Create a scorecard using Template](#create-a-scorecard-using-templates)
- [Create a custom scorecard](#create-a-custom-scorecard)

### Create a Scorecard using templates

To create a scorecard using templates:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > **All Capabilities** > **Scorecards** > **Create Scorecard**.
2. On the **Create a Scorecard** screen, click **Use a template**.
3. On the **Choose a template** screen, select a scorecard template from the list, and click **Next**.
4. On the **Manage the rules** screen:
   - Enable the required rules.
   - From the **Run this rule in** drop-down list, select the accounts to run this rule.
   - Click **Next**.
5. On the **Review your scorecard details** screen, if required, update the name and description for the scorecard. 
   - Click **Confirm & Create**.
6. After the scorecard is created, you can also add additional rules as required. For more information, refer to [Create Scorecard rule](#create-scorecard-rules).

### Create a custom Scorecard

To create your own Scorecard:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > **All Capabilities** > **Scorecards** > **Create Scorecard**.
2. On the **Create a Scorecard** screen, click **Build your own**.
3. Provide a name and description, then click **Create**.
4. After the Scorecard is created, add and configure rules to define your specific compliance criteria. For more information, refer to [Create Scorecard rule](#create-scorecard-rules).

## Create Scorecard rules

Rules in Scorecards are used to evaluate entities against specific compliance criteria. You can define rules to automate the process of validating whether your services, applications, or other resources adhere to the specific requirements.

You can create rules for Scorecards using NRQL queries. Each rule can span multiple entities and validate whether each entity meets specific conditions by evaluating to either true or false. 

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an active New Relic account ID to create this rule.
- You have a Scorecard created. For more information, refer to [Create a new scorecard](#create-a-new-scorecard).

### To create a rule:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > **All Capabilities** > **Scorecards**.
2. Select the required Scorecard.
3. Click **+ Create Rule**.
4. Select the New Relic accounts where the rule will be evaluated. This ensures that the rule applies to the correct set of data and entities. 
5. Enter an NRQL query that specifies your conditions. Your query must contain these two fields:

    - A `FACET` by `entityGUID` for example: `FACET id` as `entityGuid`
    - A score column to evaluate scores for `0` or `1`. For example, `SELECT if(latest(reporting), 1, 0) as ‘score’`. 

    Example NRQL:

    ```sql
    SELECT latest(if(tags.language = 'ruby', 0, 1)) as ‘score’ 
    FROM Entity 
    WHERE tags.environment = 'production’ and type = 'APM-APPLICATION’ 
    SINCE 1 day ago 
    FACET id, tags.nr.team as ‘team’

    ```
6. To validate your query, click Run this query. Upon successful run, a preview response appears.
	
    
Tip:
From the Use existing query drop-down list, select your previously created query to run in the rule.


Click Next.
Provide a name and description for the rule.
Click Save and create.
