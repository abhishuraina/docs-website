The [NerdGraph API explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/) is a powerful tool designed to manage metric normalization rules for your applications. By leveraging NerdGraph mutations, you can create, edit, enable, and disable these rules directly from your New Relic account. This provides a streamlined and programmatic approach to resolve [Metric Grouping Issues (MGIs).](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/troubleshooting/metric-grouping-issues)

MGIs arise when an application generates an excessive number of unique metrics, often from web transaction metrics named from URLs. This high cardinality can lead to performance degradation and make it difficult to analyze and monitor application performance effectively. Metric normalization rules offer a solution by grouping or filtering out metric timeslice data, thereby reducing high cardinality and preventing metric grouping issues.

The NerdGraph API Explorer acts as a single-pane-of-glass interface to manage all your metric normalization rules across multiple applications or instances. This centralized and flexible solution ensures consistency and significantly reduces the effort required to maintain these rules. 

This tutorial provides an overview of the NerdGraph mutations available to manage metric normalization rules in New Relic. You can use these mutations to create, edit, enable, and disable metric normalization rules as needed.


## Requirements [#review-requirements]

* You need a [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup), and with that account, you can access your API user key that you need to include with [queries and mutations](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph).

* User type and assigned roles can affect your NerdGraph permissions. For more details, refer to [Factors affecting access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data/#user-permissions).


<Callout variant="tip">
    You can also create metric normalization rule using New Relic platform. For more information, refer to [Metric normalization rules](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/metric-normalization-rules).

## Retrieve the metric normalization rules [#nerdgraph-query]


Use the `metricNormalizationRules` query to retrieve all metric normalization rules associated with your account. This query provides a comprehensive overview of the existing rules, including their status and configuration.

### Input parameters

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Attribute name</th>
            <th>Data type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>`accountId`</td>
            <td>String</td>
            <td>(Required) The account ID associated with the rule.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`enable`</td>
            <td>Boolean</td>
            <td>(Required) The status of the rule. If set to `true`, only enabled rules are returned.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Sample query

```graphql

    {
        actor {
            user {
            name
            }
            account(id: xxxxxx) {
            metricNormalization {
                metricNormalizationRules(enabled: true) {
                action
                applicationGuid
                applicationName
                createdAt
                enabled
                evalOrder
                id
                matchExpression
                notes
                replacement
                terminateChain
                }
            }
            }
        }
    }

```


## Mutations [#nerdgraph-mutations]

Manage your metric normalization rules with the following [NerdGraph mutations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#terminology):

    title="Create a metric normalization rule"
    >

Use `metricNormalizationCreateRule` mutation creates a new metric normalization rule in New Relic. This rule helps to manage the high cardinality metrics by renaming, dropping, or transforming them before they're ingested to New Relic. This helps in addressing the MGI and ensuring that your metrics are well-organized and meaningful.
