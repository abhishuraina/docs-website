The [NerdGraph API explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/) is a powerful tool designed to manage metric normalization rules for your applications. By leveraging NerdGraph mutations, you can create, edit, enable, and disable these rules directly from your New Relic account. This provides a streamlined and programmatic approach to resolve Metric Grouping Issues (MGIs).

Metric Grouping Issues arise when an application generates an excessive number of unique metrics, often from web transaction metrics named from URLs. This high cardinality can lead to performance degradation and make it difficult to analyze and monitor application performance effectively. Metric normalization rules offer a solution by grouping or filtering out metric timeslice data, thereby reducing high cardinality and preventing metric grouping issues.

The NerdGraph API Explorer acts as a single-pane-of-glass interface to manage all your metric normalization rules across multiple applications or instances. This centralized and flexible solution ensures consistency and significantly reduces the effort required to maintain these rules. 


## Requirements [#review-requirements]

* You need a [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup), and with that account, you can access your API user key that you need to include with [queries and mutations]((https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#terminology)).

* User type and assigned roles can affect your NerdGraph permissions. For more details, see [Factors affecting access](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data/#user-permissions).


## Mutations [#nerdgraph-mutations]

Manage your metric normalization rules with the following [NerdGraph mutations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#terminology):

    >

Use `metricNormalizationCreateRule` mutation creates a new metric normalization rule in New Relic. This rule helps to manage the high cardinality metrics by renaming, dropping, or transforming them before they are ingested to New Relic. This helps in addressing the MGI and ensuring that your metrics are well-organized and meaningful.

            - `REPLACE`: Replace the `matchExpression` metrics with value defined in the `replacement`.
            - `IGNORE`: Block any metrics that match the `matchExpression` from reporting to New Relic.
            -  `DENY_NEW_METRICS`: Prevent the creation of new metric names that match the matchExpression, but allow existing metric names to continue reporting.

### Sample query

```graphql

    mutation {
        metricNormalizationCreateRule(
            rule: {action: IGNORE, applicationGuid: "", enabled: false, matchExpression: "^WebTransaction/Uri/RESTfulExample/users/username/[a-zA-Z0-9]+$", notes: "", terminateChain: false, replacement: "WebTransaction/Uri/RESTfulExample/users/username/{username}", evalOrder: 2000}
            accountId: 0
        )
    }

```


### Response parameters 

Once the rule has been created, the response will have an additional a `ruleId` parameter. You can use the `ruleId` parameter to manage the rule.

```graphql

query response for create rule

```

### Sample response


```graphql

query response for create rule
