It is crucial to allocate sufficient resources to the gateway to maintain its reliability and prevent data loss. If the gateway goes down, you risk losing telemetry data, which can impact your monitoring and analytics capabilities. Ensuring that the gateway is properly sized and scaled will help maintain continuous data flow and safeguard against potential disruptions.

This guide helps you determine the appropriate resources for deploying and scaling Pipeline Control Gateway in your environment. Understanding these specifications is essential for ensuring optimal performance and efficient data processing.

## Default configuration

The gateway is configured with a default memory allocation of 2 GB per pod.

## Performance specifications

With a single CPU core and 100 drop rules per MELT type, the Gateway can process the following volumes of telemetry data:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Data Type</th>
            <th>Processing Capacity</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Metrics</td>
            <td>7,000 data points per second</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Events</td>
            <td>4,500 events per second</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Logs</td>
            <td>2,700 logs per second</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Traces</td>
            <td>3,300 spans per second</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


## Agent handling capacity

A single gateway pod can handle between 15-35 agents, with request sizes ranging from 26-250 KB of uncompressed data per second.
