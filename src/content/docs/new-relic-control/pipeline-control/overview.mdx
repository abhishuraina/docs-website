Pipeline Control is an essential part of New Relic Control, designed to optimize the management of telemetry data pipelines. It enables you to filter and discard low-value data before ingestion, thereby helping you reduce storage costs and ensure focus on the most pertinent information. This feature is especially useful when using the gateway to eliminate data before it exits your network, thus avoiding egress costs.

Pipeline Control consists of two sub-components: Pipeline Control Gateway (simply referred to as Gateway) and Cloud Rules. If your goal is to filter data or attributes before they leave your network, the Gateway is the ideal solution. Conversely, if you wish to filter data within the New Relic Cloud, Cloud Rules are the appropriate choice. In both scenarios, NRQL queries are employed to remove unwanted data. It's important to note the cost implications: while New Relic does not charge for data filtered at the Gateway level, filtering data on the New Relic Cloud incurs charges for compute resources.
