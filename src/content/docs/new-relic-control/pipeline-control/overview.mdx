Pipeline Control is an essential part of New Relic Control, designed to optimize the management of telemetry data pipelines. It enables you to filter and discard low-value data before ingestion, thereby helping you reduce storage costs and ensure focus on the most pertinent information. This feature is especially useful when using the gateway to eliminate data before it exits your network, thus avoiding egress costs.

Pipeline Control consists of two sub-components: Pipeline Control gateway (simply referred to as the gateway) and Pipeline Control cloud rules. If your goal is to filter data or attributes before they leave your network, the gateway is the ideal solution. Conversely, if you wish to filter data within the New Relic Cloud, cloud rules are the appropriate choice. In both scenarios, Pipeline Control uses an identical NRQL query syntax to process data. It's important to note the cost implications: while New Relic does not charge for data filtered at the gateway level, filtering data on the New Relic Cloud incurs charges for compute resources.

## Prerequisites
Before you get started, you must have:
- A New Relic account with organization product admin and organization manager permissions
- Familiarity with Kubernetes operations and management
- Kubernetes cluster admin access to deploy and manage resources within your cluster
- Permissions to create and manage private DNS hostnames within your network
- Permissions to create and manage DNS records
- Helm installed locally
- Understanding of NRQL to create and manage pipeline rules

## Considerations for using gateway
As you integrate and use the gateway component, here are some important considerations for you to keep in mind:

### Protocol compatibility
**APM agents protocol version:** Ensure your APM agents are updated to protocol version **17** or above for compatibility with the gateway.

### Attribute and data management
- **Attribute upport:** Some attributes may not be supported by the gateway. For detailed information, refer to the documentation provided [here]().
- **Data/attribute handling:** The gateway forwards your requests for dropping data or attributes for metric time slice data, sql_trace_data, and trace_sample_data directly to New Relic without modification.

### Parsing and data integration
- **Log parsing:** The gateway does not include Grok parsing for logs. Grok parsing is a method used to extract structured data from unstructured log messages using predefined patterns and regular expressions. You may need alternative methods to structure log data for querying and visualization.
- **Prometheus integration:** The gateway does not support Prometheus remote write for metrics, which may affect your integration with Prometheus-based systems.

### Licensing and compliance
- **License key management:** The gateway does not accommodate multiple license keys from native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) sources, such as agent collectors or APM SDKs. Consider this when managing your licenses.
- **Compliance standards:** The gateway does not support FedRAMP, which may impact your operations if you require adherence to federal security standards.

### Query functionality
**Query functions:** The gateway does not support certain functions in the WHERE clause for metric queries. The functions include:
- %[type]
- %[count]
- %[sum]
- %[min]
- %[max]
- %[latest]

Example query: `FROM Metric SELECT * WHERE (%[type]='summary' AND %[count]=0) OR (%[type]='gauge' AND %[count]=1 AND %[latest]=0)`
