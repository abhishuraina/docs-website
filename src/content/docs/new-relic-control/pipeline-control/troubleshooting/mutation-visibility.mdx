If your gateway mutation does not appear in updates after actions like saving a draft rule, deleting a rule, or changing settings, this guide will help you diagnose and resolve the issue. Follow the steps below based on the specific problem you encounter:

## Problem: API race condition
Multiple users send requests for gateway mutations simultaneously, causing changes to be lost.
**Solution**:
- Check the most recent configuration revisions for the fleet. If there are multiple recent drafts, one containing change A and another containing change B, this is likely the cause.
- Redo the action that was lost due to the race condition.
