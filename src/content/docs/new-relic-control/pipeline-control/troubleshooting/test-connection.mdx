If you're installing the gateway for the first time and **Test connection** returns a failure, this guide will help you diagnose and resolve the issue. Follow the steps below based on the specific problem you encounter:

## Problem: Fleet entity creation failure
The fleet exists on your infrastructure, but the call to create a fleet entity fails. This is because when you try to test your connection post installation, the connection process looks for an entity of the type, KUBERNETESCLUSTER. If thereâ€™s no such entity, the test fails.
**Solution**:
- Query against NerdGraph for an entity of type `KUBERNETESCLUSTER` with tags `fleetId` and `clusterName`. If this query returns no data, it indicates a problem.
- Access cluster logs to verify that the cluster is operational.
- Determine whether the entity does not exist due to a failure in fleet creation or a failure in the call to create the entity.
- If the fleet failed to create, investigate infrastructure setup and configuration.
- If the call to create the entity failed, check API call logs and retry the operation.
- Consult with fleet support for further input on possible mitigations.
