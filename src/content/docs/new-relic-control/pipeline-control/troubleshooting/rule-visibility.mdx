{/* If you've changed a gateway rule and it's not appearing in the rule list, this guide will help you diagnose and resolve common problems. Follow the steps below based on the specific problem you encounter: */}

## Problem: Undeployed change
You're unaware that the rules list shows only active states and has not deployed the change yet.
## Solution
- Check the updates page for pending updates to deploy.
- Ensure that you deploy your changes for them to be reflected in the rules list.

## Problem: API race condition
Multiple users send requests for gateway mutations simultaneously, causing changes to be lost.
## Solution
- Review the most recent configuration revisions for the fleet. If there are multiple recent drafts, one containing change A and another containing change B, this is likely the cause.
- Redo the action that was lost due to the race condition.
