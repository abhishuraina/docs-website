After your Pipeline Control setup is complete, you have to modify your agent configuration, particularly if you want to drop data/attributes via Gateway. Your agents are by default configured to send the data that they collect from your applications to the New Relic backend. But to ensure processing at Gateway, you have to route the data via Gateway. To do that, change the endpoint details to point to the Gateway, as shown in the sample configuration:

## Gateway sizing and scaling guide

This guide helps you determine the appropriate resources for deploying and scaling Pipeline Control Gateway in your environment. Understanding these specifications is essential for ensuring optimal performance and efficient data processing.

## Default configuration

The Gateway is configured with a default memory allocation of 2 GB.

## Performance specifications

With a single CPU core and 100 drop rules per MELT type, the Gateway can process the following volumes of telemetry data:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Data Type</th>
            <th>Processing Capacity</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Metrics</td>
            <td>7,000 data points per second</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Events</td>
            <td>4,500 events per second</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Logs</td>
            <td>2,700 logs per second</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Traces</td>
            <td>3,300 spans per second</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


## Agent handling capacity

When planning your deployment, consider these agent-to-Gateway rations:, a single Gateway pod can handle up to:

* A single Gateway pod can handle up to 35 agents with 26 KB of uncompressed request size per second when MELT data is sent to the Gateway.
* A single Gateway pod can handle up to 15 agents with 250 KB of uncompressed request size per second

<callout variant="tip"> These capacity estimates are based on measurements from existing deployments. Your actual requirements may vary depending on your specific data patterns and monitoring needs. </callout>
