There are two ways to install Agent Control:

## Guided
Log in to New Relic. In Integrations & Agents, click **Install Agent Control**, and then follow the on-screen instructions. 

## Manual
Follow the steps below to manually install Agent Control:
<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Add the New Relic Helm repository [#add-repo]

    1. Add the New Relic Helm repository to your local Helm environment by running:

    ```shell
    helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
    ```

    2. If the New Relic Helm repo is already present in your local Helm environment, synchronize your environment with the upstream repos:

    ```shell
    helm repo update
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Define and validate configuration [#validate]

    1. Create [a YAML file](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/agent-control/values.yaml) with your configuration settings.

    ```shell
    helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
    ```

    2. Ensure that your configuration file is correctly set up with the necessary parameters, such as your cluster name, license key, and desired managed agents.

    ```shell
    helm repo update
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Install Agent Control [#install]

    - To install Agent Control, run this command:

    ```shell
    helm upgrade --install agent-control --version 0.0.34-beta --namespace newrelic --create-namespace newrelic/agent-control --values values-newrelic.yaml --devel
    ```

    This installs Agent Control in the `newrelic` namespace of your Kubernetes cluster. Note that this command specifies the chart version explicitly using the `–version` parameter, which is recommended.

    - Alternatively, you can use the following command to perform the same installation:

    ```shell
    helm upgrade --install agent-control --namespace newrelic --create-namespace newrelic/agent-control --values values-newrelic.yaml --devel
    ```

    This command doesn’t specify the chart version. Use it only when you are not sure of the chart version.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Verify installation [#verify-install]

    - Verify the status of your pods by running:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n newrelic
    ```

    Log in to your New Relic account and navigate to the relevant dashboard to confirm that telemetry data from your Kubernetes cluster is being received. This step checks that the agents are correctly configured and sending data back to New Relic.
