  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Agent Control is an agent supervisor that can be used to deploy, update, and manage New Relic agents. 

## Prerequisites
Before you begin deploying Agent Control to your Kubernetes clusters, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

- **Helm 3:** Helm version 3 must be installed on your machine. For installation instructions, see [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install).
- **New Relic license key:** You'll need a New Relic license key to report telemetry to your New Relic account.
- **Kubernetes cluster name:** Have the name of your Kubernetes cluster ready, as it will be referenced during the installation process.
- **Auth Domain Manager:** To set up Agent Control and connect it to Fleet Control, you must have the Authentication Domain Manager role.
- **Existing instrumentation:** If you already have a Kubernetes cluster instrumented with New Relic, you have to uninstall the instrumentation and then re-install it:
  - Determine the existing instrumentation and configuration within your cluster. This may include New Relic Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests stored in your code repository.
  - Match your existing instrumentation with the supported agents in [the Agent Control configuration](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/agent-control/values.yaml).
  - Keep existing settings for each agent under the new configuration structure. Refer to [sample configurations](/docs/new-relic-control/agent-control/configuration/#sample-configurations) as needed for formatting examples.
  - Uninstall your current instrumentation for [in-scope agents](/docs/new-relic-control/getting-started/#scope). Refer to your existing agent documentation for instructions on how to uninstall them, and then prepare your cluster for the new setup.
  - [Install Agent Control](/docs/new-relic-control/agent-control/setup/#manual) with your selected agents and settings.

<Callout variant="important">
  Since New Relic Control is in public preview, we recommend using it in lower, non-production environments such as sandbox, development, staging, or testing.

## Compatibility

The solution is compatible with:
- Last three minor Kubernetes releases.
- Minikube, Kind, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

For system requirements for the Kubernetes infrastructure agent and the New Relic OpenTelemetry collector, see:
- [Kubernetes integration: compatibility and requirements](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/kubernetes-integration-compatibility-requirements)
- [OpenTelemetry for Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/k8s-otel)

{/* ## Security considerations
- Agent Control can send information to managed agents and has the ability to restart agents, change instrumentation configuration, and potentially break configuration if invalid or malicious configurations are deployed from Fleet Control.
