  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).

Agent Control is an agent supervisor that can be used to deploy, update, and manage New Relic agents. 

## Prerequisites
Before you begin deploying Agent Control to your Kubernetes clusters, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

<Callout variant="important">
  If you already have a Kubernetes cluster instrumented with New Relic, to install Agent control you must uninstall the instrumentation and re-install it. For instructions, see [migrate to Agent Control]().
</Callout>

- **Helm 3:** Helm version 3 must be installed on your machine. For installation instructions, see [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install).
- **New Relic license key:** You'll need your New Relic license key to report telemetry to your New Relic account.
- **Kubernetes cluster name:** Have the name of your Kubernetes cluster ready, as it will be referenced during the installation process.
- **Auth Domain Manager:** To set up Agent Control and connect it to Fleet Control, you must have the Auth Domain Manager role.

## Compatibility
The solution is compatible with:
- **Kubernetes versions:** 1.29, 1.30, or 1.31
- **Kubernetes platforms:** Minikube, Kind, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

## Security consideration
Agent Control can send information to managed agents and has the ability to restart agents, change instrumentation configuration, and potentially break configuration if invalid or malicious configurations are deployed from Fleet Control.

## Cost considerations
- You can install Agent Control in any supported environment. You donâ€™t require any paid entitlement.
- Agent Control is not a telemetry agent itself. Ingest cost depends on the instrumentation enabled in the managed agents (Kubernetes agent, OpenTelemetry collector, or FluentBit).
