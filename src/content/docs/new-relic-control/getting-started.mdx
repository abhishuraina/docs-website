New Relic Control is an observability management solution that provides centralized control over agent configuration and deployment. This documentation covers the solution components, core functionalities, and deployment options.

## Components
- **[Agent Control](/docs/new-relic-control/agent-control/overview):** A lightweight supervisor component that manages other New Relic and OpenTelemetry agents. It works with Fleet Control to deploy and update instrumentation.
- **[Fleet Control](/docs/new-relic-control/fleet-control/overview):** A centralized way to install, configure, and upgrade agents remotely. 

## Scope
New Relic control is currently in public preview. For now, it supports configuration management of:
- **New Relic agents:** This includes the infrastructure agent and the New Relic distribution of the OpenTelemetry (NRDOT) collector, both intended for use in Kubernetes environments.
- **Standards-based instrumentation:** This includes Prometheus and Fluent Bit.
