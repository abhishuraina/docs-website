New Relic Control is an observability management solution that provides centralized, scalable control over agents and telemetry pipelines across your environment. This documentation covers the solution components, core functionality, and deployment options.

## Components
- **[Agent Control](/docs/new-relic-control/agent-control/overview):** A lightweight supervisor component that manages other New Relic and OpenTelemetry agents. It communicates with Fleet Control to remotely configure, update, and monitor the health of infrastructure-level instrumentation.
- **[Fleet Control](/docs/new-relic-control/fleet-control/overview):** A centralized interface that provides visibility and remote management of all supervised agents across your infrastructure. It enables teams to install, configure, monitor, and upgrade agents at scale. 

## Scope
New Relic Control is currently in public preview. At this stage, it supports configuration management of infrastructure-level instrumentation for Kubernetes clusters, including:
- **New Relic agents:** Includes agents based on the New Relic infrastructure agent and the New Relic distribution of OpenTelemetry (NRDOT) collector - designed for Kubernetes environments.
- **Standards-based instrumentation:** Includes Prometheus and Fluent Bit - designed for Kubernetes environments.
