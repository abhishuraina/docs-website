Fleet Control provides centralized and remote command over fleets of Kubernetes clusters running New Relic infrastructure and logging agents under the supervision of Agent Control.

## What is a fleet?
In Fleet Control, a fleet is a homogeneous collection of managed entities, such as Kubernetes clusters, that share identical instrumentation configurations. Fleets serve as logical groupings of managed entities, allowing for streamlined management and consistent observability configuration at scale.

### Understanding managed entities
A managed entity in the context of Fleet Control refers to a Kubernetes cluster running New Relic infrastructure and logging instrumentation managed by Agent Control. Agent configuration is specified at the fleet level and every Kubernetes cluster in the fleet shares the same configuration as other clusters in that fleet.

### Homogeneous collection
A homogeneous collection means that all managed entities within a fleet are configured to run the same set of observability agents and receive the same configuration of those agents. Grouping managed entities in this way helps simplify agent management. This allows for configuration changes to be applied consistently to all agents running on managed entities in the fleet without having to manage each agent one at a time.

## Communication and user access
- **Communication protocol:** Agent Control communicates with Fleet Control using the OpenTelemetry Open Agent Management Protocol (OpAMP). 
- **User access and permissions:** As an organization product admin, you can enable specific users in your organization to create and edit fleets. Once authorized, these users can:
    - Create fleets of managed entities.
    - Edit fleet membership.
    - Deploy configuration changes to fleets.

## Key features
- **Centralized management:** Fleet Control offers a unified platform for administering agents running on fleets of Kubernetes clusters, allowing you to manage instrumentation across your infrastructure at scale.
- **Grouping and ownership:** It functions as both a grouping mechanism and an ownership boundary, enabling different teams to manage their respective fleets independently while maintaining consistent observability practices.
- **Remote configuration:** Fleet Control supports remote configuration of various New Relic agents, including the Kubernetes infrastructure agent and the New Relic distribution of OpenTelemetry (NRDOT) collector, as well as standards-based instrumentation including Prometheus and Fluent Bit.

These agents are responsible for monitoring various aspects of your environment and reporting key data points, including metrics, events, logs, and traces (MELT).

## Prerequisites
Before setting up Fleet Control, ensure that your system meets the following prerequisites:

- [Set up Agent Control](/docs/new-relic-control/agent-control/setup). You cannot directly add New Relic agents (Kubernetes, Prometheus, or Fluent Bit) to a fleet.
- Ensure you have the Org Product Admin role. This is required to create and edit a fleet. Alternatively, you can gain this access by setting up fine-grained access to a particular fleet. See the [Fleet Permissions]() section for more details.

## Considerations for creating fleets
- **Cluster preparation:** Ensure that your Kubernetes clusters are prepared and configured to support Agent Control and Fleet Control. This includes verifying network settings and ensuring compatibility with New Relic services.
- **Security and access:** Review your security policies to ensure that installing Agent Control and setting up Fleet Control aligns with your organization's standards. This may involve configuring role-based access control (RBAC) and securing communication channels.
- **Team collaboration:** Consider how different teams within your organization will manage their respective fleets. Fleet Control allows for grouping and ownership boundaries, enabling teams to manage their observability needs independently.
