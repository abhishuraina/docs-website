## Introduction

The Sequence Filtering feature allows users to filter session replays based on a specific sequence of events recorded during user interactions. This functionality is designed to help users efficiently navigate through numerous session recordings on the Session Listing Page, making the search for relevant replays seamless.

## Key Features

* **Event sequence filtering**: Users can filter replays by specifying a sequence of events in a particular order, such as a user performing a search followed by adding an item to their cart.
* **Customizable filters**: Users can select attributes, operators, and values to define their sequence filters.
* **Support for multiple actions**: Users can specify up to 5 actions in a sequence.
* **Flexible filtering**: Filters can be applied in any order, allowing users to combine sequence filters with other filter types such as duration.
