The session replay feature, when enabled, might not allow you to view replay data for iframe content. This is due to the behavior of session replay in iframe scenarios, which depend on the origin of the iframe and the placement of the browser agent.

Assuming a web page consists of a top-level window with a child iframe, these are the behaviors between session traces and iframes:   
  * **Same-origin iframes**:
    * If you place the browser agent in the top-level window, session replay captures both the window and the iframe.
    * If you place the browser agent in the iframe, session replay only captures what's in the iframe.
    * If you place the browser agent in both the top-level window and iframe, session replay captures what's happening independently in both the window and iframe, resulting in two separate sessions.
  * **Cross-origin iframes**:
    * If you place the browser agent in the top-level window, session replay only captures what's in the window. The iframe will appear blank in session replay.
    * If you place the browser agent in the top-level iframe, session replay only captures what's in the iframe.

Session replay is not compatible with `<frame>` elements.
