The New Relic Distribution of OpenTelemetry (NRDOT) is a New Relic-supported distribution of the OpenTelemetry project.
It provides a set of OpenTelemetry components that are tested and supported by New Relic.
NRDOT is designed to work seamlessly with New Relic products and services, and it is the recommended way to instrument your applications with OpenTelemetry for use with New Relic.

Currently, NRDOT includes pre-built distributions of the OpenTelemetry Collector, for language APIs and SDKs see our docs on getting started with [APM monitoring](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/apm-monitoring/opentelemetry-apm-intro/).
