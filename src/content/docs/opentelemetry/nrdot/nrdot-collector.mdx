The New Relic Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector (NRDOT) is a collection of New Relic-supported pre-built distributions of the OpenTelemetry [Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) project.
NRDOT is designed to work seamlessly with New Relic products and services, and it is the recommended way to collect, process, and export open telemetry data for use with New Relic.
Each distribution comes bundled with configs that are pre-configured to integrate with New Relic ingest.
