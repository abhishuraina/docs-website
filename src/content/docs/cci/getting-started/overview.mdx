Cloud Cost Intelligence (CCI) is designed to provide comprehensive visibility and management of cloud costs. Positioned within the rapidly growing Financial Operations (FinOps) space, CCI aims to bridge the gap between cost visibility and infrastructure observability, offering you a holistic view of your cloud expenditures.

For your large enterprise rapidly scaling its use of AWS services, tracking and managing cloud expenses can become increasingly complex. CCI assists by providing detailed insights into where your money is being allocated, enabling you to identify areas for potential cost savings. By aligning cloud expenditures with actual usage, you can optimize your budgets while continuing to support strategic growth initiatives. This approach ensures that every dollar you invest is effectively contributing to your company’s overall success.

## Key benefits
Here’s how CCI can benefit you:

### Comprehensive cost visibility
- **Breakdown by category:** View cloud costs segmented by application, service, owning team, and region.
- **Trend analysis:** Gain insights into month-on-month cost trends, average costs, and top cost drivers.

### Kubernetes cost allocation
Gain visibility into Kubernetes-related costs. We leverage telemetry data from New Relic to break down costs by application names.

### Real-time cost estimation
Cloud Cost Intelligence leverages telemetry data and historical cost patterns to provide hourly cost updates, reflecting changes within an hour of resource provisioning. This integration with your billing data allows for cost estimates based on the average unit price from the past week and New Relic telemetry data for the recent 48-hour period. Without this integration, estimates default to potentially higher standard unit pricing rates.

For the most accurate estimates, integrate telemetry and maintain at least 7 days of historical data. This data helps calculate costs for the same instances. In the absence of such data, estimates revert to on-demand pricing, the standard pay-as-you-go model used by cloud providers.

    **Cross-account data collection**<p/>
    Cloud Cost Intelligence is scoped to the user and collects telemetry data from all accounts associated with your New Relic user credential. This means that even if you're using a single New Relic account for Cloud Cost Intelligence, telemetry data from any additional New Relic accounts you have access to will also be collected and visible within that single New Relic account. Verify that your user account permissions are in line with your internal policies and permit data access to the New Relic accounts you would like to view.

## How Cloud Cost Intelligence retrieves cloud costs via storage solutions

Cloud Cost Intelligence automatically accesses your AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) in your designated S3 bucket once setup and integration is complete. This process begins with your authorization and the provision of access permissions. It is important to note that Cloud Cost Intelligence can only pull reports after the data is exported to your designated S3 bucket. Ensure that the S3 path prefix is set to cost-and-usage-reports as specified in the [prerequisites](/docs/cci/getting-started/prerequisites).

Typically AWS updates the CUR three times a day, and Cloud Cost Intelligence retrieves the CUR from your S3 bucket once an hour after setup. Your latest CUR will be visible within Cloud Cost Intelligence when AWS provides their update and Cloud Cost Intelligence retrieves it shortly thereafter.

<Callout variant="important">
**Your data privacy**<p/>
CUR is data about your usage of cloud services and their costs, which should not include personal data. Ensure the data you send is free from personal identifiable information or sensitive information before adding the CUR to your S3 bucket and before it is uploaded to New Relic. CUR data deletion is not supported at this time. We recommend not to generate the CUR with personal identifiable information or sensitive information.

**Data retention:** Our current data retention policy is to maintain the data for up to 5 years. After 2 years, data is moved to AWS Glacier, a lower-cost storage option with a higher retrieval time.

**Viewing access:** Be aware that anyone with access to the New Relic account you select during installation will be able to view all data within Cloud Cost Intelligence. Choose an account with suitable access privileges to match your RBAC and access policy requirements.

### Data analysis and reporting
After retrieving the CUR data, CCI processes and analyzes this information to present actionable insights in its dashboards. You can visualize the financial implications of your cloud usage with clarity, identifying cost drivers and potential areas for optimization.

{/* ## Future enhancements
While the initial release focuses on visibility, future iterations of CCI will include advanced features such as cost optimization recommendations. These enhancements will leverage accumulated data and insights to provide actionable suggestions for reducing cloud expenditures. */}

## Differentiation
CCI stands out in the FinOps market through its unique combination of real-time cost estimation and integration with telemetry data. This approach not only provides immediate insights but also aligns cost data with operational metrics, offering a more comprehensive view of cloud resource utilization.

## Conclusion
CCI is a powerful tool for organizations looking to gain control over cloud expenditures. By providing detailed visibility, real-time updates, and future optimization capabilities, CCI empowers you to make informed decisions and optimize your cloud investments effectively.
