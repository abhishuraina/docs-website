## Install browser application for existing browser application

To get started with browser monitoring, add our browser agent to the HTML of the views you want to monitor. The browser agent is a snippet of JavaScript code that monitors the performance of your site and sends that data to New Relic.

<Steps>

<Step>
    Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Integrations & Agents > Media Streaming > Browser**</DNT> and click <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>.
</Step>

<Step>
    Choose the video player you wish to monitor and click **Continue**.

        Click <DNT>**Request a player**</DNT> on the right, if youâ€™re unable to see your video player in the list.

    Click <DNT>**Select an application you're already monitoring**</DNT>, choose this option if you wish to add the streaming agent to an existing application.

    Copy the code and insert the snippet as close to the top of your `<head>` tag as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (such as X-UA-Compatible and charset).
