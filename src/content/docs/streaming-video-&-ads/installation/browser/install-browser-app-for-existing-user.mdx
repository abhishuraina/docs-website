To get started with browser monitoring, add our browser agent to the HTML of the views you want to monitor. The browser agent is a snippet of JavaScript code that monitors the performance of your site and sends that data to New Relic.

1. In the Select streaming app type section, choose Browser and click Continue.
2. Choose the player from the following list you wish to monitor:
    - Shaka
    - Bitmovin
    - Dash.js
    - JW Player
    - Akamai
    - HTML5
    - video.js
