## Install the browser agent [#install]

<Steps>

<Step>
    Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Integrations & Agents > Media Streaming > Browser**</DNT> and click <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>.
</Step>

<Step>
    Choose the video player you wish to monitor and click **Continue**.

    <Callout variant="important">
        Click <DNT>**Request a player**</DNT> on the right, if youâ€™re unable to see your video player in the list.
    </Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
    Click <DNT>**Instrument a new browser application**</DNT>, choose this option if you wish to add the streaming agent to a new application.
</Step>

<Step>
    There are four ways to install the browser agent. Depending on your specific needs, you can:

      <Tabs>
        <TabsBar>
          <TabsBarItem id="1">
            Get JavaScript via UI
          </TabsBarItem>

          <TabsBarItem id="2">
            Install via APM
          </TabsBarItem>

          <TabsBarItem id="3">
            Create JavaScript via NerdGraph
          </TabsBarItem>

          <TabsBarItem id="4">
            Install via NerdGraph and npm
          </TabsBarItem>
        </TabsBar>

        <TabsPages>
          <TabsPageItem id="1">
            Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Integrations & Agents > Media Streaming**</DNT> and follow the instructions to generate the browser JavaScript snippet in the UI.

            <ButtonGroup>
              <ButtonLink
                role="button"
                to="https://onenr.io/0MRNpYqNqQn"
                variant="primary"
              >
                Get your browser snippet
              </ButtonLink>
            </ButtonGroup>

            Once you have the snippet, paste it as close to the top of your `<head>` tag as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (such as `X-UA-Compatible` and `charset`).

            For more detailed information about the placing the snippet, see [JavaScript placement requirements](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/instrumentation-browser-monitoring#javascript-placement).

            (If you'd like to install the browser agent via npm, see our [`@newrelic/browser-agent` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@newrelic/browser-agent).)
          </TabsPageItem>

          <TabsPageItem id="2">
            With an APM agent, you can deploy browser streaming without manually adding the snippet to your code. When you restart the agent, it automatically uses the latest version of the browser agent.

            If you're using an APM (application performance monitoring) agent to monitor the backend of your browser app and you've got a non-[SPA](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/introduction-single-page-app-monitoring) app, then we recommend using this method.

            There are specific steps for each APM agent:

            * [Go](/docs/agents/go-agent/features/install-new-relic-browser-go-apps)
            * [Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/page-load-timing-java)
            * [.NET](/docs/agents/net-agent/features/page-load-timing-net)
            * [Node.js](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-nodejs)
            * [PHP](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/page-load-timing-php)
            * [Python](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-python)
            * [Ruby](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/features/page-load-timing-ruby)
          </TabsPageItem>

          <TabsPageItem id="3">
            If you'd prefer to create your browser snippet programmatically, you can do so via our NerdGraph, our GraphQL API.

            For more on this, see our [NerdGraph tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/browser-monitoring-config-nerdgraph/) to create a browser snippet and configure it.

            Once you have the snippet, add it to the `<head>` tag of your app.
          </TabsPageItem>

          <TabsPageItem id="4">
            If you want to automate browser streaming deployment across multiple web apps, you can use NerdGraph and our browser agent npm package to configure and deploy the agent as part of your application build process.

            For more on this, see [instrument multiple apps with npm and NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/combining-npm-nerdgraph/).

## What's next? [#whats-next]

When you've installed the browser agent, wait a few minutes and look for the data in [our Video Overview Page].

If it's been more than 15 minutes and you're not seeing data, see [troubleshoot your browser installation].

Once you're seeing browser data in the UI, here are some next steps on how you can get the most out that data:

* [View a high-level summary of your streaming data](Add it to the Summary page or second option is add it to Video Overview).
* [Ads Overview](/docs/journey-performance/guide-to-monitoring-core-web-vitals).
* [Detailed analysis of User Sessions](Add this to the User sessions).
