To get started with <InlinePopover type="browser"/>, add our browser agent to the HTML of the views you want to monitor. The browser agent is a snippet of JavaScript code that monitors the performance of your site and sends that data to New Relic.

## Before you begin [#before-start]

If you haven't done so, you may want to check that your browser app meets our [compatibility and requirements](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring).

There are two ways to install the browser agent to the application, you may choose to:

    *[Install browser agent to application youâ€™re already monitoring]
    *[Install browser agent to a new application]
