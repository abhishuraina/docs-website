## Install the streaming video & ads agent

To get started with streaming video & ads, add our media agent to the view you want to monitor. The media agent is a snippet of JavaScript code that monitors the performance of your site and sends that data to New Relic.

## Before you begin

If you haven't done so, you may want to check that your app meets our compatibility and requirements.

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Integrations & Agents > Media Streaming**</DNT>.
2. Select an account from the **Account** dropdown and click **Continue**.
3. In the **Select streaming app type** section, select the type of app you would like to monitor:
    - [Browser](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/installation/browser/getting-started-with-browser-agent/)
    - [Mobile](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/installation/mobile/get-started/)
