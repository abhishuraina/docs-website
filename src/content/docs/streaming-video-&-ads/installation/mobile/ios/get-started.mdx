Our iOS agent gives you a comprehensive view of your app's performance. The agent monitors iOS apps written in Objective-C, Swift, or both. For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see [Introduction to mobile monitoring](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/installation/mobile/get-started).

## Compatibility and requirements [#requirements]

Before you install the iOS agent, review the [compatibility and requirements](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/installation/mobile/ios/ios-compatibility-requirement).

## Install the agent [#installation]

To install the iOS agent, follow our [guided install](https://onenr.io/0qwLv87gkj5), located directly in the UI. Using this method, you can install and configure the iOS agent with Swift Package Manager (SPM) or CocoaPods.

## Extend your instrumentation [#extend]

After you install the iOS agent, you can extend its default instrumentation with various types of custom data:

* Create [dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) to query, visualize, and share performance data.
* View all the installed agent in the [Streaming entities](https://one.newrelic.com)
* Uderstand the information related to the view in the [Video overview](https://one.newrelic.com)
* Take a look at the [Ads overview](https://one.newrelic.com) to get a better understanding of the ads performance.
