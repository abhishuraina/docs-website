New Relic's <InlinePopover type="mobile"/> capabilities provide deeper visibility into the performance and crash troubleshooting of your Android, iOS, or hybrid mobile applications. You can use mobile monitoring to improve your app's user experience or examine HTTP and network performance to collaborate more effectively with your backend teams.

Once you follow our easy install flow, you'll be able to further configure mobile monitoring to suit your mobile environment.

To install the mobile agent, follow the instructions below to configure it using Gradle and Android Studio.

After installing your agent:
