In digital business, systems are becoming increasingly large, complex, and interdependent. You may have hundreds of applications and services running at the same time across different platforms, and you may need to monitor thousands of elements emitting data. To help you manage this complexity, New Relic provides a suite of tools and features to help you monitor and troubleshoot your systems.

There are two ways to view data in New Relic for **Streaming Video & Ads**:

* [Multiple platform view](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/view-data-in-newrelic/streaming-video-&-ads-all-platform-view/overview)
* [Single application view](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/view-data-in-newrelic/streaming-video-&-ads-single-application-view/all-entity)

## Key differences
