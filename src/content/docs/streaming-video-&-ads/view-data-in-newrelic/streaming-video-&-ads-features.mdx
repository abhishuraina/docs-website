In digital business, systems are becoming increasingly large, complex, and interdependent. You may have hundreds of applications and services running at the same time across different platforms, and you may need to monitor thousands of elements emitting data. To help you manage this complexity, New Relic provides a suite of tools and features to help you monitor and troubleshoot your systems.

There are two ways to view data in New Relic for **Streaming Video & Ads**:

* [Single application view](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/view-data-in-newrelic/streaming-video-&-ads-all-platform-view)
* [All platform view](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/view-data-in-newrelic/streaming-video-&-ads-single-application-view)

## Key differences

The following table outlines the key differences between the two views:

| **Aspect**                     | **All Platform View**| **Single Application View**|
| **Scope and Reach**            | Displays comprehensive data related to all platforms, providing an overview of streaming activity across iOS, Android, Roku, browser, and more. This includes a holistic view of all streaming and ad interactions across the ecosystem. | Focuses on detailed streaming data specific to a single application, such as iOS or Android. For instance, it provides insights on all activities related to the subset of customers (e.g., 10,000) streaming content on the selected platform. |
| **User Experience**            | Targeted at managerial users (e.g., Netflix managers) who need a comprehensive overview of all platforms.   | Designed for technical users (e.g., developers) who need detailed insights into a specific application.     |
| **Ad Monitoring**              | Tracks ad performance across all platforms, enabling a holistic view of ad engagement.                      | Monitors ad performance within a single application, allowing for detailed analysis of specific issues.     |
| **Data Granularity**           | Provides aggregated data for a broad perspective, useful for strategic decision-making.                     | Offers detailed, granular data for troubleshooting and optimization within a specific application.           |
| **Technology and Infrastructure** | Utilizes a centralized system to aggregate and display data from multiple platforms.                     | Relies on application-specific tools and infrastructure for data collection and analysis.                    |
| **Content Variety and Availability** | Shows diverse content performance metrics across platforms.                                              | Focuses on the content performance within the specific application, potentially limiting variety.            |
| **Analytics and Insights**     | Delivers cross-platform analytics, useful for identifying trends and patterns across the entire ecosystem. | Provides insights specific to the application, allowing for targeted improvements and optimizations.         |
| **Feature Set**                | Includes video overview, ads overview, streaming entity view, and user sessions for all platforms.          | Offers video overview, ads overview, user sessions specific to the application, and the ability to set up alert conditions. |
| **Alerting and Notifications** | Generally provides broad alerts and notifications relevant to overall platform performance.                 | Allows for setting up specific alert conditions tailored to the application's performance and issues.        |
