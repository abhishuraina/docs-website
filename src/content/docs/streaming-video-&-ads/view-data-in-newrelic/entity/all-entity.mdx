* All [Entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) at New Relic refer to anything we monitor that generates or contains telemetry. Entities help you find the data you want to track in New Relic, and if you understand their relationships with other entities, you can get even more insights into your data. Here are a few examples of entities:

You can work with entities right in our UI (see [Learn about New Relic entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic)), or you can follow the steps here about working with entities through our NerdGraph API. If you need help getting started with NerdGraph, see our [Introduction to New Relic NerdGraph](/docs/introduction-new-relic-graphql).

## Before you get started [#before-you-get-started]

Before working with entities, we recommend reading [Learn about entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic).

When working with entities, some important things to keep in mind:

* A unique GUID identifies an entity (`entity.guid` or `entityGuid`).
* An entity exists in New Relic for a [specific time period](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic#expiration).
* An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events or for contextualizing data related to other entities.
