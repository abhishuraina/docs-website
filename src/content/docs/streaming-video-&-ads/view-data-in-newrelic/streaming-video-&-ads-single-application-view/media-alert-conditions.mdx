                  One of the easiest ways to get started is to use our <DNT>**Golden signal or metric**</DNT> option. When selected, this capability gives you a guided creation path for making a condition. All you have to do is select the options you want and let us do the rest!

                  The following example will use specific options, but you can change whatever you need to create the exact alert condition that fits your specific needs.

                  1. Select **Video players** and click **Next**

                  2. Select the entities to watch. You can choose from a list of available entities or use the search bar to find specific ones.

                  3. Select the **Golden metrics** and click **Next**.

                  3. Select <DNT>**Golden signal or metrics**</DNT>.
                </Side>
              </SideBySide>

              <SideBySide>
                <Side>
                  <img
                    width="70%;"
                    title="golden metrics"
                    alt="A screenshot displaying the golden metrics alert creation option"
                    src="/images/alerts_screenshot-crop_golden-metrics.webp"
                  />
                </Side>

                <Side>
                  4. Choose any of the listed entity categories to determine what the alert condition will monitor. For this example, <DNT>**On host integrations**</DNT> is selected, but you can choose any other option that better suits your needs.

                  5. If you are using services like AWS, Kubernetes, on host integrations, and others, you will also need to select an entity type before you can select an individual entity. Select the entity type to narrow down the options for the next step.

                  6. Select the entity or entities you want to monitor. If you have many entities to choose from, you can use the filter field to shorten the list and find what you need.
                </Side>
              </SideBySide>

              7. Select the signal you want to monitor. This example uses <DNT>**interaction to next paint (INP) (75 percentile)**</DNT>, but you can use any other option that better suits your needs.

                   src="/images/alerts_screenshot-crop_golden-metric-entities.webp"
                 />

                 You can choose a curated golden metric, or select from any other metric that has reported in the last 30-minutes.

                 <img
                   title="Golden metric entities"
                   alt="A screenshot displaying the other metrics option"
                   src="/images/alerts_screenshot-crop_other-metrics.webp"
                 />

              8. Select <DNT>**Next**</DNT> once you've finished to save your progress and move on to the next step.

          <TabsPageItem id="create-alert-nrql">
            While using charts is a great way to create alert conditions from premade queries, sometimes you need to create them from scratch. The process for creating a new alert condition from a NRQL query is almost the exact same as creating it from a chart: the key difference is that you write the NRQL query manually instead of using a pre-generated one.

            <Callout variant="tip">
              NRQL stands for New Relic's Query Languageâ€”a standardized query method that powers all our charts, and which you can use to analyze and query your data. If this is your first time working with NRQL, you may want to check out our [NRQL docs](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) to learn more about NRQL, including [how it works](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-how-nrql-works/) and an [introductory tutorial](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-tutorial/).

              src="/images/alerts_screenshot-crop_NRQL-query.webp"
            />

            1. From <DNT>**one.newrelic.com**</DNT>, select [<DNT>**Alerts**</DNT>](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts-ai), then [<DNT>**Alert conditions (policies)**</DNT>](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts-ai/alerts-classic/policies).

            2. Select <DNT>**New alert condition**</DNT>.

            3. Write the NRQL query to create the condition. For example, if you wanted to monitor slow transactions, you can enter:
               ```sql
               SELECT average(duration) from Transaction facet name
               ```

            4. Select <DNT>**Next**</DNT> once you've finished to save your progress and move on to the next step.
