In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, modern applications have become increasingly complex, leading to a significant rise in Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR). This complexity arises from the diverse components that make up modern applications, such as databases, serverless functions, browsers, mobile applications, message queues, infrastructure, AI models, and services. Monitoring these individual services is no longer sufficient. Application owners require comprehensive visibility across their entire application ecosystem.

New Relic's Dynamic Workload Monitoring (DWM) offers a revolutionary approach to application monitoring and troubleshooting by automatically capturing and correlating all entities and data related to a specific problem or question. DWM provides:

- **Automatic Discovery**: Dynamic service relationship mapping and real-time transaction flow visualization.
- **Comprehensive Visibility**: Full-stack monitoring, cross-service transaction tracking, and infrastructure to browser visibility.
- **Historical Analysis**: Access to weeks of historical data, enabling trend analysis and pattern recognition.

You need to enable distributed tracing to use workload performance monitoring. Most of the experience is available to everyone; however, the Advanced Maps and Trace Flow map components in the Transaction Workload view require Advanced Compute.

## Features and benefits

* **Automatic workload construction**: WPM automatically builds workloads based on the focal transaction, eliminating the need for manual setup. It dynamically maps relevant front-end and service entities using distributed tracing and entity relationships.

* ** Comprehensive data integration**: The system integrates critical data from across the platform, including session replays, transaction lists, alert conditions, and deployment changes, providing a holistic view of the workload.

* **Enhanced troubleshooting**: By combining transaction models with distributed tracing, DWM offers an unsampled, accurate view of service performance, enabling users to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## Getting started

To get started with Dynamic Workload Monitoring, you need to enable distributed tracing in your New Relic account. Once enabled, you can access the Transaction Workloads feature from the New Relic One homepage.
