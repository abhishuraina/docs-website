In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, modern applications have become increasingly complex, leading to a significant rise in Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR). This complexity arises from the diverse components that make up modern applications, such as databases, serverless functions, browsers, mobile applications, message queues, infrastructure, AI models, and services. Monitoring these individual services is no longer sufficient. Application owners require comprehensive visibility across their entire application ecosystem.

New Relic's Transaction 360 offers a detailed approach to application monitoring and troubleshooting by automatically capturing and correlating all entities and data related to a specific problem or question.

Key features of Transaction 360 include:

- **Automatic Discovery**: Dynamic service relationship mapping and real-time transaction flow visualization.
- **Comprehensive Visibility**: Full-stack monitoring, cross-service transaction tracking, and infrastructure to browser visibility.
- **Historical Analysis**: Access to weeks of historical data, enabling trend analysis and pattern recognition.

You need to enable distributed tracing to use Transaction 360. Most of the experience is available to everyone; however, the Advanced Maps and Trace Flow map components in the Transaction Workload view require Advanced Compute.

## Getting started

To get started with Transaction 360, you need to enable distributed tracing in your New Relic account. Once enabled, you can access the Transaction 360 feature from the New Relic One homepage.
