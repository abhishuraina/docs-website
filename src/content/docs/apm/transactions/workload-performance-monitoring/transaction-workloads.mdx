When application performance issues arise, it's crucial to have a systematic approach to identify and resolve the root cause. This guide walks you through troubleshooting application performance issues using Workload Performance Monitoring (WPM).

Since WPM automatically captures and correlates all entities and data related to a specific problem or question, it provides a comprehensive view of the workload. This view includes the transaction flow, service relationships, and performance metrics, enabling you to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## Navigate to the Transaction Workloads view

To access the Transaction Workloads view, follow these steps:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)> APM and Services**.
2. From the APM summary page, click **Transactions > Transaction Details > View Transaction workload**.

## Understand the Transaction Workloads view

The Transaction Workloads view provides a detailed breakdown of the transaction workload, including the following components:

* **Trace Flow map**: Visualizes the transaction flow, showing the services involved and the time taken by each service.

* **Service-APM**: Lists the services involved in the transaction workload, along with their performance metrics.

* **Entity Summary** At the top of the page, review the Entity summary. Note the number of entities involved, including Browser entities, APM services, and Infra host entities. Check for any entities missing alerts.

* **Change Tracking:** Examine the Change Tracking section. If only a few change markers are present and located at the left side of the tile, changes are likely not the cause of the issue.

Alerts Analysis: Expand the Alerts tile to analyze alerts by severity and domain. Look for alerts clumped at the right-hand side of the chart, indicating recent issues.

### APM Section
Response Time Analysis: In the APM section, review the Response time chart. Look for latency spikes across the services. Note any services that do not show spikes, as this may indicate they are not directly affected.

### Transactions Table

Scroll down to the Transactions table to identify transactions with the highest percentage change in response time. Pay attention to transactions from services that are downstream or directly impacted.

### Infra Section
Infrastructure Analysis: In the Infra section, examine the Related Entities component. Focus on the Hosts table, sorted by CPU Utilization in descending order.

Identify Infrastructure Bottlenecks: Check if any hosts have 100% CPU utilization. If all top hosts are associated with a specific service (e.g., Service 4), this indicates a scaling issue affecting the service's performance.

By following these steps, you can systematically identify and address performance issues within your application. In this example, the investigation revealed that the infrastructure supporting Service 4 was overutilized, causing latency issues that impacted upstream services. Addressing the scaling issue for Service 4 should resolve the performance degradation across the application.
