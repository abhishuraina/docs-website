When application performance issues arise, it's crucial to have a systematic approach to identify and resolve the root cause. This guide walks you to view application performance issues using Transaction 360.

Since WPM automatically captures and correlates all entities and data related to a specific problem or question, it provides a comprehensive view of the workload. This view includes the transaction flow, service relationships, and performance metrics, enabling you to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## Navigate to the Transaction 360 view

To access the Transaction Workloads view, follow these steps:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)> APM and Services**.
2. From the APM summary page, click **Transactions > Transaction Details > Show dynamic workload**.



The Transaction 360 view provides a detailed breakdown of the transaction workload, including the following components:

* **Transaction 360 Overview**: Displays the transaction workload summary, including the number of entities involved, alerts, and change tracking.

* **Trace Flow map**: Visualizes the transaction flow, showing the services involved and the time taken by each service.

* **Participating entities**: Lists the services involved in the transaction workload, along with their performance metrics.


### Transaction 360 Overview

The Transaction 360 Overview section provides the following high-level summary of the associated transaction workload:

* Workload entities: The total number of entities involved in the transaction workload providing insights such as number of instrumented and uninstrumented entities, and the number of entities with alerts.

* issues: The number of issues detected in the transaction workload, including alerts and change tracking markers.

* change tracking: The number of change tracking markers detected in the transaction workload, indicating changes in the workload's performance.

### Trace Flow map

The Trace Flow map visualizes the transaction flow, showing the services involved and the time taken by each service. The map provides a high-level overview of the transaction workload, enabling you to identify bottlenecks and performance issues.

You can select related services to view the tracing metrics between them. Additionally, you can also assign a Team to the transaction workload to facilitate collaboration and issue resolution, or group related entities using Tags to streamline the investigation process.

The Trace Flow map helps you identify the services that are directly impacted by performance issues, enabling you to focus your investigation on the root cause.

### Participating entities

The Participating entities section provides a detailed breakdown of the services involved in the transaction workload, such as, APM Services, browser applicatioins, mobile applications, serverless functions, or infrastructure entities.

The APM services table displays the performance metrics for each service, including  throughput, error rate, latency, and issues with severity levels, such as critical, warning, and info, to prioritize your investigation.
You can also use the Transactions table to identify transactions with the highest percentage change in response time, enabling you to focus your investigation on the most impacted transactions. Additionally, you can select a specific transaction to view its trace flow and performance metrics.

Similarly, you can further investigate the performance of browser applications, mobile applications, serverless functions, and infrastructure entities to identify bottlenecks and performance issues.
