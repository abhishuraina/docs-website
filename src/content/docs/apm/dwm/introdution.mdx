In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, modern applications have become increasingly complex, leading to a significant rise in Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR). This complexity arises from the diverse components that make up modern applications, such as databases, serverless functions, browsers, mobile applications, message queues, infrastructure, AI models, and services. Monitoring these individual services is no longer sufficient. Application owners require comprehensive visibility across their entire application ecosystem.

New Relic's Dynamic Workload Monitoring (DWM) offers a revolutionary approach to application monitoring and troubleshooting by automatically capturing and correlating all entities and data related to a specific problem or question. DWM provides:

- **Automatic Discovery**: Dynamic service relationship mapping and real-time transaction flow visualization.
- **Comprehensive Visibility**: Full-stack monitoring, cross-service transaction tracking, and infrastructure to browser visibility.
- **Historical Analysis**: Access to weeks of historical data, enabling trend analysis and pattern recognition.

You need to enable distributed tracing to use transaction Workloads. Most of the experience is available to everyone; however, the Advanced Maps and Trace Flow map components in the Transaction Workload view require Advanced Compute.

## What are transaction workloads? [#feature]

Transaction Workloads are the first implementation of the Dynamic Workload Monitoring feature. The goal is to capture a collection of entities and data that could impact a focal transaction or be impacted by that transactionâ€™s performance. It uses:

- **Focal Transaction**: Sets the primary point of investigation and provides context for relationship mapping.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Maps service dependencies, tracks transaction flows, and identifies bottlenecks.
- **Entity Relationships**: Connects related services, maps infrastructure dependencies, and links browser and mobile components.
