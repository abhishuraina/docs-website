Before you [install New Relic's Ruby agent](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation-and-configuration/ruby-agent-installation), make sure your system meets these requirements for compatible operating systems, security protocols, Ruby versions, and supported frameworks/libraries.

If you don't have one already, start by [creating a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, forever.

## Operating systems [#os]

The Ruby agent supports UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. Windows is not officially supported for production environments but may work for development.

## Security requirements [#security]

* **Data Collection:** As a standard [security measure for data collection](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security/data-security), your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit) for SSL communication with New Relic. SHA-1 is not supported.
* **TLS:** New Relic requires TLS 1.2 or higher for all inbound connections from the agent.

## Ruby versions [#ruby_versions]

The New Relic Ruby agent does not support experimental or non-official Ruby versions. The agent is continuously tested against official Ruby releases.

| Ruby Implementation | Supported |  Notes |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| **CRuby (MRI)** | 3.4.x, 3.3.x, 3.2.x, 3.1.x, 3.0.x, 2.7.x, 2.6.x, 2.5.x, 2.4.x | Ruby 2.3.x, 2.2.x: Last fully supported by agent v8.16.0. <br/> Ruby 2.1.x, 2.0.x: Last fully supported by agent v6.15.0. <br/> Ruby 1.9.3: Last agent v3.18.1. <br/> Ruby 1.8.7: Last agent v3.18.1. |
| **JRuby** | 9.x | JRuby 1.7.x: Last agent v3.18.1. Older versions are not supported. |

*Note: "Last fully supported by agent vX.Y.Z" means that agent version X.Y.Z was the last to guarantee support. Newer agents may still function but are not actively tested against those older Ruby versions.*

## Web servers [#web_servers]

The Ruby agent supports the following web servers. Instrumentation typically hooks into Rack.

| Web Server | Supported  | Notes |

New Relic collects [instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues). The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version.

We support the following adapters:

| Database | Adapter Gem Name(s) |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **PostgreSQL** | `pg`, |
| **MySQL** | `mysql2`, `trilogy`|
| **SQLite** | `sqlite3` |

This is not a comprehensive list.

## Notes on Supported versions [#notes_on_supported_versions]

* The agent may be compatible with a broader range of versions (older or newer) than explicitly listed. However, the listed versions receive the most rigorous testing.
* For the most up-to-date information on newly supported versions or deprecations, always refer to the [Ruby agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes).
* If a library is not listed, it may still be instrumented if it relies on an underlying technology that *is* instrumented (e.g., a framework built on Rack, or an ORM using a standard database adapter). For critical unlisted libraries, you can explore [custom instrumentation](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/api-guides/ruby-custom-instrumentation) or [submit a feature request](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

If you have questions about specific versions or libraries not covered here, please visit our [Explorers Hub community forum](https://forum.newrelic.com/).

## Other APM software [#other_monitoring_software]

If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we can't guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we can't offer technical support. For more information, see [Errors when using other monitoring software](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/troubleshooting/errors-while-using-new-relic-apm-alongside-other-apm-software).


## Connect the agent to other parts of New Relic [#digital-intelligence-platform]

The Ruby agent integrates with other New Relic capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility.

| Capability | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| [AI monitoring](/docs/ai-monitoring/intro-to-ai-monitoring) | You can collect AI data using the Ruby agent and the [`ruby-openai` gem](https://github.com/alexrudall/ruby-openai). This feature was introduced in Ruby agent version 9.8.0 and supports `ruby-openai` versions 3.4.0 and above. |
[Browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/introduction-browser-monitoring) | The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you [enable auto-instrumentation](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent#select-apm-app). After enabling browser injection, you can view <InlinePopover type="browser"/> data in the [APM Summary page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data) and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the [browser and Ruby agent documentation](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/features/new-relic-browser-ruby-agent). |

[Infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/get-started-infrastructure-monitoring) | When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your hosts by APM app in the infrastructure UI. For more information, see [APM data in the infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/new-relic-apm-data-infrastructure). |
[Synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/get-started-new-relic-synthetic-monitoring) | [Synthetic transaction traces](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/collect-synthetic-transaction-traces) connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction. |
