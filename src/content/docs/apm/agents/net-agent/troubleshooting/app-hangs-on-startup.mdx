## Problem

Your .NET 8.x application hangs on startup when using the .NET agent.

## Solution

The root cause of this issue is a [bug](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/93175) in the .NET runtime.  This bug is fixed in .NET 9.  A fix was backported to .NET 8, but since the fix involves a breaking change, it is not enabled by default.

To enable the fix, apply the following AppConfig to your application:

```
"configProperties": {
 "System.Diagnostics.Tracing.CounterCallbackOnTimerThread": true
} 
```

This setting can also be applied by changing your msbuild project file or using an environment variable.  See Microsoft's documentation of [.NET runtime configuration settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/runtime-config/).
