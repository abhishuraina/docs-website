## Introduction

The integration of New Relic's RAG (Retrieve and Generate) feature with confluence allows users to enhance their troubleshooting and documentation processes by directly referencing confluence content within New Relic AI's responses. This integration is particularly useful for organizations that rely on confluence for maintaining their runbooks and documentation.

## Features of Knowledge Integration confluence integration

* **Automatic Ingestion and Indexing**: The Knowledge Integration confluence feature automatically ingests and indexes your confluence content, ensuring that all relevant documentation is readily accessible.
  
* **Direct Reference in AI Responses**: When using Ask AI, it will directly reference your confluence pages. This ensures that users receive precise and relevant information from their organization's documentation.

## Manual upload via API

<Steps>

<Step>
  ## Customer Executes the Script

    * Write a script using the Confluence Query Language (CQL).

    * The script is designed to interact with the RAG system to collect and prepare data for analysis.
</Step>

<Step>
  ## Upload the Script to Cloud Storage

    * Upload the script to the designated cloud storage solution.

      * **For Azure Blob Storage**:

        * Use the Azure Storage SDK or the Azure Blob Storage API to authenticate and upload the script.

      * **For Amazon S3 Buckets**:

        * Utilize the AWS SDK or Amazon S3 API to authenticate and upload the script.
      
  Ensure that the uploaded script complies with the predefined naming conventions and structure to facilitate the indexing pipeline.
</Step>

<Step>
  ## Authenticate with New Relic

    * You must provide your New Relic API key to allow the RAG system to interact with the New Relic API.
    * This API key will typically be used for retrieving performance data or pushing custom events/data.
</Step>

<Step>

  ## Trigger the indexing pipeline

    * Once the script is uploaded to the cloud storage and authenticated with the New Relic API key, an indexing pipeline is automatically triggered.

</Step>

</Steps>
The pipeline performs the following tasks:

Validates the script.

Indexes the data retrieved or generated by the script.

Processes the indexed data based on specific criteria or rules defined in the quickstart pipeline.

Step 5: Monitor and Log the Process
The RAG system provides monitoring and logging capabilities throughout the entire process.

Customers can track the status of their script execution and indexing pipeline through a dashboard or API endpoints.

Step 6: Notification of Completion/Error Handling
Upon completion of the indexing process, customers are notified via their preferred method (e.g., email, webhook).

If any errors occur during the execution or indexing, the system captures the details and notifies the customer for troubleshooting and resolution.
