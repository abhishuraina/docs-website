### New docs
* Announced June 16, 2025, as the End of Life date for the [Metrics and Events Explorer](/eol/2025/05/metrics-and-event-explorer/).
* Added [instructions to create customer interactions](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/android-agent-custom-Interaction/) via Android agent.

### Major changes

* Added the `NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILENAME` environment variable override to the [Node.js agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration/#filename).
* Added a setting to the Ruby agent's [distributed tracing configuration](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration/#distributed_tracing-sampler-remote_parent_sampled) that manages transaction sampling behavior with a remote parent when the trace flag is set in the traceparent.
* Added Google Gen AI SDK as supported library for Python agent in the [Compatibility and requirements for AI monitoring](/docs/ai-monitoring/compatibility-requirements-ai-monitoring/) page.
* Added a feature on the [alert condition page](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#disable-health-status-reporting) that allows you to prevent automatic changes in entity health status when an alert notification occurs.
* Added enhancements in customization of the log table view in the [Use logs UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#customizable-table-views) page.
* Added information on [using NRDiag](/docs/new-relic-control/agent-control/troubleshooting/#nrdiag) to troubleshoot common issues when installing or operating Agent Control.
* Extended the End of Life date to May 21, 2025, for removing older [Synthetic monitor public minion IP](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/administration/synthetic-public-minion-ips/#dynamic-ip-addresses) ranges from the JSON IP range list.
* Updated the [Agent Support for ARM64/Graviton and x86_64](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/support-arm-graviton-x86-64/) document to reflect that infra agents and on-host integrations support ARM64 exclusively in Linux environments.
* Removed Dashboards from the asset list that are deleted upon [user deletion](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks/#delete-users).
* Added information about new user capabilities for the [Application Not Responding (ANR) UI](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/application-not-responding/#view-anr-new-relic) on the New Relic Platform.
* Updated [eligibility guidelines](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/eligibility-guidelines-new-relic-nonprofit-program/#exceptions) for New Relic's Observability for Good program.

* Updated the [compatibility and requirements for Node.js agent](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent/).
* Updated the [compatibility and requirements for the Python agent](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-python-agent/).
* Update the [compatibility and requirements for .NET agents](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements/).

* Updated [documentation](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-cosmos-db-document-db-monitoring-integration/#metric-data) to reflect that `Microsoft.DocumentDB/mongoClusters` are not supported in Azure Cosmos DB (Document DB) monitoring integration.
