Regularly upgrading the Fluent Bit agent offers you the benefit of the latest features, performance improvements, and security patches. When a newer version becomes available, you can upgrade directly from the New Relic UI.

## Steps to upgrade
1. In your New Relic account, click **Integrations & Agents**, and then open the **Installed** tab.<br/>You’ll see the list of agents and integrations currently installed.
2. Use the search entities field or the Type filter to narrow down the list to Fluent Bit agents.
3. Identify the relevant agent.
4. In the Version column, check if there’s an update available. 
5. Click the **Update from vx.y.x to X.Y.Z** to start the upgrade process.
6. [PLACEHOLDER TEXT]

### Considerations
- Before upgrading, ensure your current configurations are backed up. Review any release notes or documentation to understand new features or changes.
- After upgrading, verify log collection and processing to confirm the agent operates as expected. Use New Relic's monitoring tools to check that everything is running.
