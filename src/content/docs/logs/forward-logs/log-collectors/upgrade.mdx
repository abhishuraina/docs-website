<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Upgrade the Fluent Bit agent regularly to take advantage of the latest features, performance improvements, and security patches. [When a newer version becomes available](/docs/release-notes/fluentbit-release-notes), you can upgrade directly from the New Relic UI.

## Steps to upgrade
1. In your New Relic account, click **Integrations & Agents**, and then open the **Installed** tab.<br/>Youâ€™ll see the list of agents and integrations currently installed.
2. Use the search entities field or the Type filter to narrow down the list to Fluent Bit agents.
3. Identify the agent that requires an upgrade.

5. Click the **Update from vx.y.x to X.Y.Z**.
6. In the side panel that slides in, click [View release notes](/docs/release-notes/fluentbit-release-notes).
7. On the Fluent Bit release notes page, note the latest Helm chart version.
8. Back in New Relic, close the side panel and click the fleet that contains the agent. It opens the fleet summary in New Relic Control.
9. Select the Fluent Bit configuration.
10. Update the chart version in the configuration file per the chart version you noted earlier, and save your changes.
11. Deploy the configuration.

  If an agent isn't part of a fleet yet, [add the agent to a fleet first](), and then perform the steps to upgrade.
</Callout>

### Considerations
- Before upgrading, ensure your current configurations are backed up. Review any release notes or documentation to understand new features or changes.
- After upgrading, verify log collection and processing to confirm the agent operates as expected. Use New Relic's monitoring tools to check that everything is running.
