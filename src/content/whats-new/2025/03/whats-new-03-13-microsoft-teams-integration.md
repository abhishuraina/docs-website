We are making it easier to send notifications to Microsoft Teams â€“ you can now integrate New Relic with Teams to receive critical alerts and updates in your channels. Previously, customers had to configure a webhook or design a workflow within Microsoft Teams using the Workflows app to send alert notifications. With the new integration, you can install the [New Relic for Microsoft Teams app](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/Office365/WA200008155) to connect and send notifications directly to Teams channels in just a few clicks.


To get started, check out our [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/get-notified/microsoft-teams-integrations).
