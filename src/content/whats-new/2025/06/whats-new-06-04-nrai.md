The power of intelligent observability is now easier to access than ever before through New Relic AI, leveraging leading large language models (LLMs) within our New Relic AI assistant to help you understand both your system and the New Relic platform itself. Using natural language processing (NLP), you can ask New Relic AI questions to gain deeper insights and faster resolution throughout your digital estate. You can leverage New Relic AI to help you demystify the complexity of your stack, ensure uptime, and turn your business-critical data into actionable insight so you can maximize decision-making and improve your bottom line.

You can chat with our AI, interact with it in the NRQL console, or work with our AI tools directly in the UI, or use our integrations with other AI assistants like GitHub CoPilot.

We're providing you with increased control over New Relic AI and associated costs starting May 6th: Monitor consumption: Track your consumption using our Usage UI to understand your data usage related to New Relic AI features. Modify access to New Relic AI capabilities: If you need to modify access to New Relic AI for your organization, refer to our user management docs for how to configure role-based access using New Relic groups and roles.

If you make no changes and your organization has the Advanced Compute add-on provisioned for your account, New Relic AI feature usage will contribute to your overall monthly product usage. If you make no changes and your organization does not have the Advanced Compute add-on, New Relic AI features will be unavailable. Please reach out to your New Relic representative for help with upgrading your account.
