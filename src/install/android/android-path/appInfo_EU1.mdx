2. Select the Android agent plugin to your project. Regarding the location of the plugin, you have two options:
      
    - Recommended: Using the Gradle plugin DSL
      - Starting with agent version 7.6.0, the Android agent plugin is available on the Gradle Plugin Portal as a community plugin. The Gradle plugin DSL simpifies adding plugin dependencies to apps.
      - This method involves adding the agent plugin dependency to your project's plugins DSL block.
    - Legacy Plugin ID (newrelic)
      - For older projects or specific use cases, you can use the legacy plugin ID.
      - This method involves adding the agent as a dependency to your project's build script, specifying the MavenCentral repository.
