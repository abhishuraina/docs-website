To get started with <InlinePopover type="browser"/>, add our media agent to the HTML of the views you want to monitor. The media agent for browser is a snippet of JavaScript code.

## Prerequisites [#before-start]

If you haven't done so, you may want to check that your browser app meets our [compatibility and requirements](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/).

## (Recommended) Guided installation [#guided-install]

To install the Browser agent, follow our [guided install](https://onenr.io/08jqaJD9pjl), located directly in the UI.
