To get started with <InlinePopover type="browser"/>, add our media agent to the HTML of the views you want to monitor. The media agent for browser is a snippet of JavaScript code.

## Prerequisites [#before-start]

If you haven't done so, you may want to check that your browser app meets our [compatibility and requirements](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring).

## Install the media agent [#install]

Ready to get started? Click the <DNT>**Guided install**</DNT> button. Or, if your organization is located in an [EU data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers), click <DNT>**EU Guided install**</DNT>.
