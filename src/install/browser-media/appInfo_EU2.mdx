<Callout variant="tip">
    Add our streaming agent to an application that already has our browser agent installed. If you are a first time user and want to add the media agent to a new application, see [Instrument a new browser application](/install/browser-media/?task=newapplication).
</Callout>

    1. Add the video agent to your application by copying the code snippet and pasting it as close to the top of your `<head>` tag as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (such as `X-UA-Compatible` and `charset`).

    <img
          width="80%;"
          title="code snippet"
          alt="code snippet"
          src="/images/code-snippet.webp"
      />

    2. Click **See your data** to generate the data.

<Callout variant="important">
    It may take a few minutes to interact with your application and generate data.
