    1. There are four ways to install the media agent on your browser. Depending on your specific needs, you can:

            Place a JavaScript snippet in frontend code
          </TabsBarItem>

          <TabsBarItem id="2">
            Connect browser data to an application's APM data
          </TabsBarItem>

          <TabsBarItem id="3">
            Install with NPM
          </TabsBarItem>

          <TabsBarItem id="4">
            Install with NerdGraph
          </TabsBarItem>
        </TabsBar>

            1. Enter a name for your application and, click **Save and continue** to create the application.

            2. In the Configure the browser agent page, click **Save and continue**.

            3. The browser JavaScript snippet is generated in the UI.

            4. Once you have the snippet, paste it as close to the top of your `<head>` tag as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (such as `X-UA-Compatible` and `charset`). Click **Continue**.

            For more detailed information about the placing the snippet, see [JavaScript placement requirements](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/instrumentation-browser-monitoring#javascript-placement).

            5. Click **Continue** when asked on where you want to install the media agent.

            6. Add the video agent to your application, by copying the below code snippet and pasting it as close to the top of your `<head>` tag as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (such as `X-UA-Compatible` and `charset`).
            
              <Callout variant="important">
              Include the downloaded script in your application, ensure it is placed below the existing browser agent code.
              </Callout>

            With an APM agent, you can deploy browser streaming without manually adding the snippet to your code. When you restart the agent, it automatically uses the latest version of the browser agent.

            If you're using an APM (application performance monitoring) agent to monitor the backend of your browser app and you've got a non-[SPA](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/introduction-single-page-app-monitoring) app, then we recommend using this method.

            There are specific steps for each APM agent:

            * [Go](/docs/agents/go-agent/features/install-new-relic-browser-go-apps)
            * [Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/page-load-timing-java)
            * [.NET](/docs/agents/net-agent/features/page-load-timing-net)
            * [Node.js](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-nodejs)
            * [PHP](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/page-load-timing-php)
            * [Python](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-python)
            * [Ruby](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/features/page-load-timing-ruby)
          </TabsPageItem>

          <TabsPageItem id="3">
            If you'd prefer to create your browser snippet programmatically, you can do so via our NerdGraph, our GraphQL API.

            For more on this, see our [NerdGraph tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/browser-monitoring-config-nerdgraph/) to create a browser snippet and configure it.

            Once you have the snippet, add it to the `<head>` tag of your app.
          </TabsPageItem>

            If you want to automate browser streaming deployment across multiple web apps, you can use NerdGraph and our browser agent npm package to configure and deploy the agent as part of your application build process.

            For more on this, see [instrument multiple apps with npm and NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/combining-npm-nerdgraph/).
