    "description": "Notes The Browser Agent, sometimes called the JS Agent, has multiple variants: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA. Unless noted otherwise, all features/improvements/bug fixes are available in all variants of the agent. New features Added the setCurrentRouteName API method [relevant only for Pro+SPA] : The agent now has an API method to set the current route name for the page. This api can be used to set the previousRouteName and targetRouteName for BrowserInteraction events. For details on how and why to use this API, see our Browser SPA API Docs Improvements Disabled insecure communication with New Relic : Previously the agent would send RUM data to the router without TLS if the request was initiated from an insecure page. Now the Browser Agent will always use TLS connection when transmitting data. Browser Agent no longer mutates the attributes object passed to the addPageAction API : Previously the agent would mutate the attributes object passed to add page actions by adding the default and page attributes onto this object. Bug fixes Fixed a compatibility issue with zone.js : Previously when the Browser Agent and zone.js were both included on a page, additional event handlers would be triggered twice. For example, when event handlers were added as properties, such as onreadystatechange, these handlers would be triggered twice in some browsers. This issue has now been resolved. Fixed a bug with cross-frame callbacks : Previously, when adding event handlers for events in iframes, the agent would attempt to wrap the provided callbacks. When the wrapping logic called the callback belonging to another frame, a permissions exception would be thrown. The agent will now only wrap callbacks created in the same frame.

This latter functionality is off by default, until a curated UI experience is created to utilize this data.

Add resiliency around SPA interaction saving Added resiliency code around SPA interaction node save functionality to ensure a cancelled interaction node without a parent further up the interaction tree does not cause an exception to be raised from the agent.

Bug Fixes Resolve Google indexing of agent relative paths In previous versions, the agent script included relative paths to its lazy-loaded chunks, which Googlebot picked up and attempted to index as pages. This change removes those relatives paths from the loader and centralizes our lazy chunk loading of agent features. Refactor wrapping of Promise object The agent's wrapping of the Promise object has been refactored to address conflicts with third party libraries and to add newer methods available on the native object. The new wrapping implementation is more conventional and less error-prone. Fix uncaught promise error introduced in v1223 In some cases of failure to import agent script chunk \"629\", an error was thrown rather than caught and logged as a warning.

The agent now collects the same data in Chrome for iOS as in other supported browsers. Expose build version to newrelic global The build version is exposed to the newrelic global object. You can access it with newrelic.intializedAgents[<agentID>].runtime.version. Internal Add automation for documentation site updates on new releases A new release of the browser agent will automatically raise a PR to the documentation site with the relevant changelog items. Bug Fixes Fix multiple custom interaction end times Fixed an issue where multiple custom interactions harvested at the same time would result in only one interaction being persisted in New Relic. Prevent AJAX time slice metrics based on deny list Prevent time slice metric collection for AJAX calls when such a call matches an entry in the AJAX deny list. Bind navigator scope to sendBeacon Some browser versions will throw errors if sendBeacon doesn't have the navigator scope bound to it. A fail-safe action of binding the navigator scope to sendBeacon was added to try to support those browsers. Preserve unhandledPromiseRejection reasons as human-readable strings in error payloads The agent will attempt to preserve unhandledPromiseRejection reasons as human-readable messages on the Error payload that gets harvested. The previous strategy didn't always work, because Promise.reject can pass any value, not just strings. Fix missing interactions for dynamic routes in Next/React Fixed an issue where when using the SPA loader with Next/React, route changes that lazy loaded components wouldn't be captured. While the issue specifically called out Next/React, this should apply to Nuxt/Vue and Angular. Fix interactions missing API calls in Angular Fixed an issue where when using the SPA loader with Angular, route changes that contained API calls, via Angular resolver, wouldn't capture the xhr/fetch on the interaction.

    "description": "New Features EXPERIMENTAL - Unblock instrumented pages from the back/forward cache (w/ feature flag) An instrumented page's back-forward cache eligibility was hampered by the agent's unload listener, which will be removed  when a feature flag is on. With the allow_bfcache enabled in the init config, the agent's definition of (the end of) an user's session is more refined, and it will no longer be blocking the browser from utilizing its respective b/f cache. Internal Reduce size of builds for modern browser targets The agent is now compatible with only modern web syntax (ES6+) ; this reduces loader size for these browsers by 20% or more . We target and test support for just the last ten versions of Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox -- see browser agent EOL policy  for more details. Bug Fixes Prevent feature from collecting and harvesting future data if account entitlements are invalid The agent will now attempt to shut down an initialized feature if account entitlements are invalid. Accounts that lack entitlements to use certain endpoints will see many 403 errors in the console without this behavior. This behavior requires the Page View Event feature to be enabled. Do not collect XHR events for data URLs AJAX events for data URLs have not historically been collected due to errors in the agent when handling URLs without hostnames. Going forward, XHR calls to data URLs will not cause agent errors and will continue to be excluded from collection. Fix nrWrapper exclusion in error stack traces Restoring previous functionality whereby the nrWrapper agent method should be excluded from JavaScript error stack traces. Fix errors with global self redefinition Fixing an issue where external code redefining the self global variable causes the agent async loading to fail and the agent to crash.

    "description": "New Features Add infrastructure to run on web workers The agent's infrastructure will now allow for the agent to be built to run on web workers for future projects. Bug Fixes Expose webpack library as output type \"self\" vs. \"umd\" To address \"mismatched anonymous define\" errors thrown by RequireJS, the agent's webpack library output will no longer include UMD checks for CommonJS and AMD module environments, and will instead be exposed globally via self. Fix custom attribute handling in cases where the info block is loaded after initialization Fixed an issue where custom attributes could be cleared and reset if the info block was included on the page below the loader script. Our guidance still remains that all configurations should be included on the page above the loader code , however this is an attempt to do no harm when feasible for backwards compatibility. Update JS error bucketing algorithm The agent will now take into account the error object type, message, and original stack trace when deciding on whether multiple JS errors should be bucketed together. Fix initial page load interaction reporting with Nuxt Fixed an issue where when using the SPA loader with Nuxt, the initial page load interaction was never being completed. This resulted in events like errors being retained in memory and never harvested because they were tied to an incomplete interaction. Fix error with jsPDF library and SPA agent Fixed an issue with the jsPDF library where it was not correctly detecting browser native support for Promises due to our wrapper. This resulted in an exception and jsPDF not generating the PDF. This issue is not present with the pro or lite agent. Note : This issue does not affect the pro or lite agent. This change allows the jsPDF library to function correctly when the SPA agent is used. However, it does cause an internal error within the agent to be generated. This error does not break the agent, jsPDF, or other functionality. The issue is planned to be addressed in a future update.",

    "description": "This release is in public preview. We're slowly rolling out these features to different browser agents based on the browser's instrumentation method. Here's the release timeline: Internal NR Platform release date: 10/07/2022 Production APM-injected release date: 10/7/2022 Production Standalone release date: Estimated around 12/13/2022 New Features Capture unhandled Promise rejections The Agent now observes and captures unhandled Promise rejections as JavaScript Error objects. Removed 3rd Party Cookies The browser agent no longer uses 3rd party cookies to maintain and track session information. 1st party implementation using window.sessionStorage is now used, which is automatically cleared when a page session ends. This is still managed using the privacy settings form in your browser application settings. LCP is no longer reported on initially-hidden pages LCP metrics are no longer reported on pages whose state is hidden at load time, such as tabs refreshing in the background of a focused tab. Async Module Loading Individual features of the browser agent can now be dynamically loaded, enabled, or disabled at runtime. Removal of script tag injection The agent no longer inserts other features into the page via a script tag insertion. It now uses network requests to instantiate other code modules. Updated test process In an effort to better support the majority of our traffic, the test suite required to merge PRs has been updated to run against the latest 10 major versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Android, and the latest 5 major versions of Safari and iOS. As part of this process, outdated code and polyfill libraries aimed at supporting deprecated browsers are no longer included in production builds by default. Bug Fixes Fixed issue with BrowserInteraction nodes generating circular references BrowserInteractions no longer generate circular trees when they are self referential. Remove non-ASCII characters from builds Certain dependencies were appending non-ASCII characters to build files. These characters were affecting older Python agent implementations downstream that worked to parse and encode the agent snippet. The build files are now checked and cleaned of non-ASCII characters before shipping.",

Automatically obfuscate file:// protocol A change has been implemented in our handling of applications hosted locally on a file:// protocol. For security reasons, we can not send payloads that contain file information, so our previous implementation revolved around completely shutting the agent down when file:// protocols were detected. This change automatically obfuscates all file:// paths from our payloads before sending to ingest. Bug Fixes Fixed issue with trace ID random hex character length The final character in trace ID hex generation was returning as undefined, which translated to always be 0 (undefined & 15 === 0).  This change fixes this final character and ensures it is valid.",

    "description": "New Features We are excited to announce the release of Cumulative Layout Shift , the third and final metric in Google's Core Web Vitals . This metric is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. The current set for 2020 Core Web Vitals focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds): Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more about the research and methodology behind these recommendations, see: Defining the Core Web Vitals metrics thresholds . Tools that assess Core Web Vitals compliance should consider a page passing if it meets the recommended targets at the 75th percentile for all of the above three metrics. How does the Browser Agent report this data? The agent now collects CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) values as attributes on PageViewTiming events. CLS measures how much layout of the page shifts and is represented as a score. All types of PageViewTiming events (except FP and FCP) include this attribute, showing the score up until the point the timing measurement was taken. You can now track your CLS score throughout the page loading cycle to better understand and focus your optimization work on the moment in time where you are experiencing the worst scores. We have also added two new events to the PageViewTiming event, pageHide and windowLoad to complete the full page load journey. These timings are useful with its CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) attribute to paint the picture of a user's journey through the load experience. The pageHide  event represents the first time that the page was hidden (e.g. by switching browser tab). Note that we only collect the first pageHide events at this point. The windowLoad  event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For more information, please visit our docs on the PageViewTiming event . Issue Fixes [PageViewTiming event] Fixed unrealistic high values for FI & FID Older browsers report Event.timeStamp as an epoch time instead of value relative to the page navigation start. The agent took this into account for FI (First Interaction) timing values but not for FID (First Input Delay). With this fix, there should no longer be unrealistic outlier values for FID.

    "description": "New Features Browser in distributed tracing  now supports W3C trace context headers. W3C Trace Context  is a standard that makes distributed tracing easier to implement, more reliable, and ultimately more valuable for developers working with modern, highly distributed applications. The standard greatly simplifies use cases where developers instrument services using tools from different distributed tracing solutions. Now all tracers and agents that conform to the W3C Trace Context standard can participate in a trace. Trace data can be propagated from the root service all the way to the terminal service. Once Distributed Tracing is turned on in your Browser Application Settings page, the trace context headers will be added by default, along with the newrelic proprietary header, for same origin AJAX requests. If your system is fully configured to send w3c trace context throughout all services, you can choose to disable the newrelic header from the Application setting tab. For cross origin AJAX requests already configured to accept the newrelic header, you can now select the option to send the W3C trace context headers. When selected, all origins defined must be configured to accept the traceparent and tracestate headers. For information on configuring CORS headers , please see our docs page for an example. As with the same origin requests, if you system is fully configured for W3C trace context headers, you can choose to disable the newrelic header. For more information, please see our New Relic Support for W3C Trace Context  blog post. The following New Relic agents now support W3C: Browser Pro+SPA agent 1173 and higher Java 5.1.0 and higher Python 5.5 and higher Go 3.1.0 and higher Node.js 6.4 and higher Ruby 6.9.0 and higher PHP 9.8 and higher .NET 8.27 and higher",

    "description": "New Features Privacy: Added the ability for admin users to toggle cookie collection On/Off via Browser Application Settings UI The agent now accepts new configuration privacy.cookies_enabled. When it is set to false (OFF), the agent doesn't write any third party cookies (JSESSIONID  & NREUM ) and it also notifies the intake server to not return a third party cookie. By default, all current and newly created applications will have this value set to true (ON), so there will be no change in the data currently being collected by the agent. Admin users must toggle the setting to OFF and redeploy the agent in order to see this change take effect. Once cookie collection is set to false, users should no longer see session information captured with their event data. If a session was already in progress, that data will continue to be collected until that session expires. New sessions should report a null value. Please note that auto-injected apps will receive this update before the UI option is available. See release dates below.

    "description": "New Features With this release of the New Relic Browser agent, we now support new metrics, largestContentfulPaint and windowUnload, in our PageViewTiming event. With the release of Chrome 77, Google now reports a metric called largest contentful paint . This metric, LCP for short, reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport, along with the element size and element Id values. This new metric comes after extensive research by Google . They found that the more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded is to look at when the largest element was rendered. Largest Contentful Paint is replacing First Meaningful Paint (which is now a deprecated metric) in Google Lighthouse as well. Additionally, LCP is considered the \"field\" equivalent to the Speed Index \"lab\" metric. Largest Contentful Paint is updated over time, but captured and reported when one of these three criteria is met: A user interacts with the page, thus potentially changing the content in the viewport The user closes the page (the window unload event fires) If no other other interaction happens, and we have received a LCP value, we will report that value after 1 minute has passed If we have not received a value, and no interaction has occurred after a minute, we will simply wait until we have received any value for LCP. This would only occur for very high values (> 1minute) of LCP. In addition to this metric, we added the windowUnload  event to PageViewTiming, so you can see when your users are most commonly closing their sessions. This metric is supported by all browsers on both desktop and mobile devices. For more information about these new metrics, supporting attributes and browser compatibility, visit our PageViewTiming documentation. Issue Fixes Fix to resolve repeated InvalidStateError errors associated with IE11 and some Edge versions. How to upgrade To upgrade your agent to the latest version, see Upgrade the Browser agent .",

    "description": "New features Support for End User Originated Spans in Distributed Tracing New Relic now supports end-to-end distributed tracing with this release. For our Browser & APM Pro customers, you can now enable the Browser spans for any app that uses our Browser Pro + SPA agent.This MVP includes support for same-origin AJAX requests that originate during a BrowserInteraction event. This AJAX request will be listed as the root entry span for a trace. Learn More For more details about APM & Browser agent version requirements and enablement, see our Browser Data in Distributed Tracing Page . Please note that not all APM agents are supported at this time. For more details about all supported Span attributes, visit our Event Data Dictionary Known Issues Enabling Browser in Distributed Tracing for use with current versions of these language agents, Java, PHP, and C, will result in disconnected traces (single span traces for all Browser requests) and potentially the loss of APM transaction traces and spans. Please see the APM compatibility requirements  for supported versions and estimated release dates. New PageViewTiming Event to capture User Centric Perceived Performance metrics in real time With this release, we are tying together the visual and responsiveness performance for our customer's site. With every page view, the agent is now capturing the time of the first interaction along with FID (First Input Delay). The existing paint timing metrics (First Paint and First Contentful Paint) are now collected even when they occur after the load event. All of these new metrics are captured on the new PageViewTiming events, available in Insights. This new event type is available for all agents, but requires a Browser Pro subscription . Visit our New Relic Event Data Dictionary for a list of attributes and more details about the PageViewTiming event . First Interaction First Interaction timing captures the moment in time that a user first engages with a site. Within this timing, we also capture the type of interaction (click, key, mousedown, etc). This timing represents the first step in calculating the First Input Delay, which is the time from First Interaction to the moment that the site responds (is interactive). First Input Delay FID is a metric that tracks the delay between the time a user can attempt to interact with a part of the site (for example, when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control), and the time that the interface is able to respond to that interaction. We have all experienced situations where a webpage has visibly loaded, but when we try to click around on buttons or any JavaScript-powered interactive elements, nothing responds. This delay is what the FID metric tracks. The FID metric  is in some ways an intersection of the First Contentful Paint and Time to Interactive metrics. It lies in the middle of those two points, measuring the time between the FCP (and therefore when a first input can be made) and when the browser’s main thread is able to respond to any interactions. One major point of FID that differentiates it from Time to Interactive is that it requires  a user to interact! TTI can be calculated without user input, so it is somewhat less powerful in the sense that it isn't providing any new information about my user's active experience or frustration, we can only assume that slow = bad. Why only consider the first input Learn more For more information and query examples, see our PageViewTiming event documentation . For more information about the Paint Timing browser compatibility, see the Browser compatibility and requirements documentation . For more information about User-Centric Perceived Performance metrics, visit the Google Developers Web Fundamentals Guides on Performance . For more information about the difference between FID and TTI, see When Users Click: Tracking First Input Delay Improvements Browser interactions now wait on external scripts to finish loading : Browser interactions measure the time of all Javascript code that runs as a result of an interaction. The agent now includes the time it takes to load and execute external scripts. This is useful, for example, when the code started by an interaction must be loaded first (lazy loading).

Improvements Updated the timing of when page URL is collected:  The URL collected by the agent and used for page view names is now collected after the load event to account for redirects. Currently, we are using the referrer header value from the initial agent call for transaction naming and for URL attributes on Insights events. The agent also sends the URL value as a part of its payload to get around HTTP header stripping.

    "description": "Notes The Browser agent, sometimes called the JavaScript agent, has multiple variants: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. Unless noted otherwise, all features/improvements/bug fixes are available in all variants of the agent. New features Action Text:  The agent now captures the text of the HTML element that was clicked when a browser interaction started. This value is stored as an attribute called actionText on the BrowserInteraction events. There is also a new API actionText , which can be used to manually set the action text value. Bug fixes The agent now uses a fallback method for collecting data when sendBeacon fails:  Browsers can return false from sendBeacon call when it cannot be completed. The agent now detects it and falls back to a different method to ensure data is captured. Fixed calculating stackHash value in Safari 10 and 11:  The stackHash value was not being properly calculated for global errors in Safari 10 and 11, causing incorrect grouping of errors across all browsers. Fixed issue with calling fetch without any arguments:  On certain versions of the Safari browser, calling fetch without any arguments is permitted. Other browsers, in contrast, do not allow this and throw an error. This also prevented the agent from working properly. Removed response size calculation for streaming fetch calls:  Previously, the agent cloned the response of a fetch call and read the response body in order to capture its size. In certain versions of the Safari browser this caused other clone calls to fail. As a result, the agent now only uses the content-length header, when available, to capture response size.

Unless noted otherwise, all features/improvements/bug fixes are available in all variants of the agent. Bug fixes Do not instrument SPA without a wrappable XHR:  In browsers that don't orchestrate the wrapping of XHR, the SPA agent does not collect event data, only metric timeslice data . The agent will still report SPA for browsers that support XHR wrapping. Mobile Safari and a few other browsers didn’t support wrapping the XMLHttpRequest, so they would not produce event data for instrumenting Single Page Apps. They still collect other types of metrics. Support setTimeout with a string duration:  When you call setTimeout with a string as the duration, browsers will cast this as a number, but the agent did not handle this correctly. We are now handling this case correctly. Work around mutation observer memory leak in IE 11:  We have discovered that MutationObserver in IE causes a memory leak, so the agent now will prefer setImmediate for IE, and use a resolved promise to schedule the wrapping in Edge (and other browsers that support promises). Handle short recursive timers:  Some libraries recursively set timers that left our interactions open. The agent now handles this by reducing the max time it will allow to be included in the interaction. How to upgrade To upgrade your agent to the latest version, see Upgrade the Browser agent .",

    "description": "Notes The Browser Agent, sometimes called the JS Agent, has multiple variants: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA. Unless noted otherwise, all features/improvements/bug fixes are available in all variants of the agent. Improvements Adjusted PageAction limits:  Previously, we limited PageAction events to 120 per page load and only 20 events per harvest cycle, resulting in dropped data if a user sent more than 20 pageAction events in a single burst. Increasing the harvest time to 30 seconds also increases the event buffer, allowing users to send up to 60 events per harvest. Improved time measurement:  Previously, the agent used the system clock to calculate timing, and since the system clock may shift over the lifecycle of a page, the agent could occasionally report inaccurate or unexpectedly negative values. Going forward, the agent will use perfomance.now(), which is a monotonically increasing clock that starts from navigationStart. This change will result in more accurate timing for modern browsers.

These will now function the same whether the agent loads or not. How to upgrade To upgrade your agent to the latest version, see Upgrade Browser agent .",

Improve notifications of stylesheet status for session replay The agent reports internal metadata about the status of stylesheets on the page when collecting session replay information. This process was spotty and the logic has been improved to make the metadata more consistent.  The ability to turn off \"inlining\" the stylesheets has been removed, as that behavior is required for the UI to re-render the replay. Add soft navigations to Browser-Agent loader Add the Soft Navigations limited preview feature to the default Browser Agent loader accessible via NPM. Update TimeKeeper Source of Truth Update the Agent's TimeKeeper to evaluate a timestamp provided directly by the consumer instead of a generic Date header, which should provide more control stability and granularity to the time synchronization processes. Bug fixes Improve reliability of customMasker The customMasker method of the Session Replay feature has been fixed to be more reliable with DOM elements that do not fit web-standards, as to not throw errors when processing.

    "description": "v1.265.0 Features Standardized feature buffering behavior We've established one pattern for holding data before harvests and for retry logic that can be shared by the all of the features. This reduces bespoke logic per feature and establishes a pattern for use with future architecture changes. Add WebSocket wrapper and supportability metrics We added a wrapper to detect usage of WebSockets. This is intended to help evaluate viability of the agent tracking WebSocket data and its overall mechanism usage patterns. Configure session replay to wait for DOMContentLoaded We decreased the time spent waiting by triggering the session replay mutation observer wrapping on the DOMContentLoaded event instead of the previously used window load event. This ensures wrapping is completed before the load chain. Removed internal barrel exports We reduced the loader bundle size by reworking the internal source code imports and exports. Added payload size evaluation to generic events feature We've changed data harvesting, where now harvesting occurs early when the payload reaches 64kb and and will harvests from sending if it exceeds the 1MB ingest limit. Bug fixes Fix duplicative log payloads on unload Ensure agent clears buffer on page navigation unload harvests to prevent duplicative payloads from being sent. Ensure drain target is a valid event emitter before subscribing Ensure that the drain target is a valid event emitter to ensure that the .on method exists and will not throw errors. Telative timestamps in session trace In rare cases where PerformanceNavigationTiming API is undefined, session trace timing nodes would be reported using epoch timestamp values instead of relative timestamp values. This would result in a broken session trace experience in New Relic. If the PerformanceNavigationTiming API is unavailable, the epoch timestamps will now be converted to relative timestamps accounting for user clock difference with New Relic servers. Updated logging API function Fix an issue where the logging API method would always result in an uninitialized agent warning and would not capture the log. Security fixes Apply obfuscation rules to session trace A bug was introduced in version 1.259.0 where session trace data was not being processed through configured obfuscation rules. This fix ensures session trace data is properly obfuscated. Potential areas where un-obfuscated data could be added to the session trace: When calling newrelic.addToTrace, the name of the trace event is a string provided by the customer. When capturing session trace nodes for ajax requests, the node will contain the current page URL excluding query parameters and hash fragments. When capturing resources being loaded on the page (javascript and css files), the session trace node will contain the URL of the resource excluding query parameters and hash fragments. When a user clicks a link on the page containing an href that includes a hash fragment and does not result in a hard page load, the href value of the link will be captured in a session trace node. When the browser agent captures an error on the page, the message of the error is included in a session trace node.

    "description": "v1.258.0 Features Restructure AJAX Aggregate Re-organization of the Ajax feature as part of agent maintenance. This has no expected impact on its functionality. Maintain calculated NR server time for session This update changes the agent to store the New Relic server time calculated when session tracking is enabled. This will prevent the agent from re-calculating server time on subsequent page loads, ensuring the timeline view of events in New Relic is more accurate. Add harvestId to Session Replay payloads Adds a unique harvest ID to Session Replay payloads to support better indexing and querying on the platform. JSErrors timestamped per harvest JSErrors that happen multiple times throughout a page's life will now receive a timestamp unique to the agent harvest cycle instead of consistently reporting the timestamp of the first occurrence of that error. Bug fixes Clean up xhrWrappable Remove xhrWrappable which is an old variable checking for addEventListener on XHR.

Apply deny list to ajax metrics The ajax deny list has historically only applied to the collection of ajax events and not ajax metrics. With this feature, the deny list will also be applied to the collection and reporting of ajax timeslice metric data.

    "description": "v1.239.1 Features Add best effort to detect Ajax events before instantiation Add a \"best effort\" at detecting ajax events that may have happened on the page before the agent was instantiated by utilizing the ResourceTiming browser API. Add mode to enable agent to not harvest until user consent Add ability for customers to wait to start harvesting. This behavior will utilize a configuration setting in tandem with an API call to trigger features to begin harvesting. Remove allow_bfcache flag Removes unused code which still relied on the window unload event. Going forward, the only method the agent will use to monitor potential end of page session will be visibility change in accordance with modern web practice. Remove old supportability metrics Removing supportability metrics that are no longer needed including polyfill detection, bfcache usage, body and query bytes sent count, and custom attributes size. Bug Fixes Fix issue with leaking event listeners Fixing an issue where session timeout would result in rewrapping global event handlers. For instances where the site would be open for long periods of time, such as kiosks, this would eventually result in a degradation in event handler performance. Issues with types resolution Fixing issues with typescript throwing errors when trying to resolve the typings for individual features with \"moduleResolution\": \"node\" set in the tsconfig.json. \"moduleResolution\": \"nodenext\" and \"moduleResolution\": \"node16\" will enable typescript use of the exports field of our package.json but could also break other libraries and forces developers to change all local imports to include file extensions.

Undefined deny list ignores block internal In cases where the customer's configuration does not include the init.ajax.deny_list property, the agent would not properly account for the init.ajax.block_internal setting and would not block Ajax events for internal agent network calls.

Add warning for large payloads Add warning for large payloads, which is typically caused by excessive custom attribute sizes. reduce jserrors wrapping and remove onerror use Replaces the use of the onerror global function with addEventListener to capture errors that go unhandled by customer code. This does not change how unhandled promise rejects are captured. Additional wrappings for events, timers, and animation fames have been removed in favor of capturing unhandled errors using a global event listener. Bug Fixes Remove fetch keep-alive unhandled rejection Eliminate an unhandled promise rejection error caused by fetch failure in agent EoL logic. prevent invalid error stack traces Removing the instantiation of the Error class in the jserrors feature for instances where a non-Error value is thrown from customer's code. In such cases, an Error instance would be created and the stack trace would point back to the agent code as the source. This causes confusion since it makes it seem like the agent code is throwing the error when that is not the case. Instead, the internal UncaughtError class will be used and no stack trace will exist.

Instead, manual API calls may be used to capture JavaScriptError and PageAction events via the noticeError and addPageAction methods.

All data transmitted by the agent will now default to using XMLHttpRequest POST calls except for data transmitted during a visibility change or page unload. Visibility changes and page unloads will use sendBeacon with a fallback to fetch with keepalive. For browsers that do not support sendBeacon, the final data transmission will use XMLHttpRequest POST. Bug Fixes Handle chunk load promise error introduced in 1.235.0 Starting in 1.235.0, loading the agent in browsers with strict privacy settings resulted in an uncaught error in a promise.

    "description": "v1.230.0 Add persistence for custom attributes Custom attributes may now optionally be persisted between page loads via session storage. The API method setCustomAttribute now takes a third parameter, which defaults to false. When true, this boolean indicates that the provided custom attribute should be persisted in session storage and restored on subsequent page loads. Session storage is subject to the same-origin policy  of the browser. Add setUserId API A new setUserId API method is now available. It defines a custom attribute containing a specified user ID, to be included in all payloads. The setUserId API is an extension of the setCustomAttribute API and automatically persists between page loads. Fix npm package browser targets The previous npm package release included code that was not compatible with browsers in our supported browser list . The package exports will now default to code that matches our browser support list. The package will also include the source code for power users that would like more control over how the agent is built. Fix npm package exports Some dangling, unused, and non-existent imports and exports were causing issues with consuming the NPM package in some projects. These have been removed. Fix npm package import for typescript projects Fixed an issue where typescript projects attempting to import the browser agent library would not get proper auto-complete in the import statement and would receive module declaration errors. The browser agent will not use tsc to generate type definitions from the JavaScript code at build time. The package.json has been updated with appropriate type export declarations. Add error catch around sendBeacon Added error catch logic around the sendBeacon usage. In the event sendBeacon throws an error during the final harvest, the final harvest will attempt to fall back to the image data submission method. Remove array reduce polyfill Removed the array reduce polyfill in favor of the native browser array reduce method.

Use the + (void) setMaxOfflineStorageSize:(unsigned int)megaBytes; API to set the maximum amount of data that can be stored locally. More info The feature flag NRFeatureFlag_OfflineStorage was added to disable the above mentioned offline storage.

    "description": "Fixed in this release [#fixed] Fixes async requests so they appear in distributed tracing. Adds NRFeatureFlag_NewEventSystem feature flag. Enable this flag to use our new, more stable, event system for iOS agent: Adds configurable request header instrumentation to network events: The agent will now produce network event attributes for select header values if it detects headers on the request. The header names to instrument pass into the agent when started. For more information, see Adding Tracked Headers  in the Mobile Monitoring documentation. Adds GraphQL attributes to network events: If the agent detects request headers from Apollo GraphQL servers, it will add additional attributes to the network request event. For more information, see Adding Tracked Headers  in the Mobile Monitoring documentation. Other notes With the 7.4.6 release, the XCFramework no longer includes the dsym-upload-tools.

Critical sections of the agent have been isolated to prevent agent-related errors from destabilizing the host application, and certain classes of errors will be automatically reported to New Relic without the need for customer-initiated communication. Performance tuning. Overhead for on-device code tracing has been reduced by over 50% in some cases. The agent will consume less CPU time on the mobile device, resulting in improved application responsiveness and lower battery drain. Improved data accuracy. Under certain conditions it was possible for the SDK to record total time for method invocations but not record the associated exclusive time. This improvement will result in more accurate breakdown charts and tables, and improve the collection of certain interaction traces. Fixes This release resolves multiple stability issues in the SDK. We recommend this release for any customers who have encountered application crashes with previous SDK versions.",

This update provides compatibility with the new beta and previous versions of the Android Gradle plugin. Fixes With Strict Mode enabled in Android Studio, there may have been a resource leak detected with the Android agent installed. This has been corrected for Strict Mode compatibility and to prevent potential resource leaks. An edge case scenario was detected where an app left open past the scheduled timeout value would continue sending data on the standard harvest cycle rather than the timeout value. This was corrected to ensure the timeout count is reset and respected. A small number of network error types in the Android agent were found to be reporting invalid codes that resulted in missing exceptions on the Errors page for the app. This behavior was corrected and each type of exception is now properly displayed in the Errors screen.

    "description": "Notes Improvements API methods now check for bad values and throw IllegalArgumentException Previously, our API methods would silently discard bad data without recording errors or metrics. We've changed this behavior to be more informative by throwing an exception when bad arguments are passed. Fixes Android Gradle plugin 0.10 compatibility Version 0.10.0 of the plugin introduced a subtle change that caused errors during build time that would produce ClassCastException errors at runtime. We’ve fixed this issue and verified we're also compatible with 0.11. Improved thread safety in the API Some API methods exhibited race conditions under heavy utilization. These race conditions are now solved. Summary metrics occasionally exhibited bad values You may have noticed strange numbers in your application overview chart. We've isolated the cause of these numbers and fixed the underlying issue in the agent.",

You'll now be able to see your application's usage of the device's CPU(s) as a percentage of the total CPU time. Fixes Restore compatibility for building with Java 7u55 and support Java 8. Java 7u55 introduced a slight change that broke our build process. We've corrected this issue and added support for Java 8. Applications without version numbers crashed the agent. Strangely, it's possible to build an Android application without a version number defined in the manifest. We now detect this case and shut down the agent cleanly with an error message indicating we require a version number. Encode custom Http(s) error response bodies. Http(s) error response bodies are normally encoded to ease escaping. However, errors reported via the API were not encoded. We've fixed this so all errors should appear properly in the UI.",

Now, Fragments have first class treatment and will show up alongside Activities. OkHttp instrumentation. If you're using Square’s OkHttp library, you'll now see your HTTP transactions automatically appear on RPM. There’s no longer any need to use the agent API to track these transactions. Fixes Clear all metric caches after a failed harvest cycle. In rare cases where the agent is unable to connect to New Relic's servers, some metric caches persisted and caused unusually large metric numbers. Now, all these caches are cleared at the end of the cycle to prevent compounding aggregation. Improved inflight interaction naming. There are some cases in which renaming a running interaction did not fully rename the metric scope. This fix ensures all aspects of the interaction bear the new name. Fixed an issue in Proguard bytecode handling. While compiling Android apps with Proguard's optimizations turned on is discouraged, the agent does its best to support such optimizations. However, we mishandled one such case and have fixed it in this release.",

    "description": "Fixes Ensure interactions complete when an app leaves the foreground. Previously, it was possible for an interaction to persist across application foreground/background lifecycles if a trace segment was still in flight. This resulted in interaction traces extending past the default 60-second limit. Now, interactions are stopped when the app leaves the foreground regardless of segment states. Machine metrics continue generation upon app restore. Machine metrics now continue to generate after an app has been in the background and enters the foreground. Previously, they were only generated from launch until the app entered the background. Improve BitmapFactory instrumentation scoping. BitmapFactory’s static method instrumentation is now scoped to more tightly to its package and class to prevent instrumentation of similar but unrelated method signatures. Added more instrumentation to summary metrics. Now all instrumented methods are included in summarized category metrics including those only present in background threads. Added missing methods to HttpsUrlConnection instrumentation. Several missing proxy methods have been added to our HttpsUrlConnection shim. This restores the ability to override default HTTPS behavior.",

    "description": "This new version makes significant changes to the number of components that are deployed to the cluster, and introduces many new configuration options to tune the behavior to your environment. We encourage you to take a look at what's changed in full detail here . Breaking changes The number and format of the metrics reported by version 3 of the integration have not changed with respect to earlier versions. The format of the values.yml file has changed to accommodate the newly added configuration options. Please take a look at our migration guide  to see how to change your configuration. Changed Our solution is now deployed in three components: A DaemonSet to monitor the Kubelet, deployed in all nodes of the cluster. A second DaemonSet to monitor the control plane, deployed in master nodes only. A Deployment to collect metrics from kube-state-metrics, deployed in the same node as the latter. We now offer better control for CPU and memory limits and requests, which can be now configured for the three components individually. Impact of discovery and collection operations on the API server has been greatly reduced, thanks to the use of kubernetes informers . Logs messages have been greatly revamped to surface problems more clearly. Added Comprehensive configuration options have been added to provide fine-grain control to how the integration discovers and connects to metric providers. Remarkably: Discovery options for control plane components have been improved. You can check the details on how discovery is configured here . It is now possible to collect metrics from control plane components running outside of the cluster. Discovery options for KSM and the kubelet have also been added. The interval at which metrics are collected is now configurable .",

    "description": "Breaking changes With the addition of Kubernetes 1.22.x support, we are phasing out of the support bracket Kubernetes versions 1.15.x and below. This means the supported versions bracket for this version and the rest of the nri-kubernetes 2.8.x branch is from Kubernetes v1.16.x to v1.22.x. Users may still use previous versions of the integration and their Helm charts to instrument their clusters, and limited support will be offered for them. Development for said older versions is considered stopped and New Relic does not guarantee feature parity or bugfixes (security or otherwise) for those older versions. Changed Node status and conditions are now fetched from the API Server rather than KSM, which fixes some inconsistencies in the samples. This does not change which data is reported, and should be an invisible change. (#194). Add a series of parameters which allow to configure a jitter to be applied to API Server response caching, which might help to spread the load on large clusters. (#185).",

Changed:  When querying the summary endpoint from Kubelet to get the Node or Pod network metrics, if the default network interface is not eth0 then summary endpoint for Kubelet doesn't return the metrics as we expect them. We rely on them being a direct member of the \"network\" object. See rxBytes, txBytes and rxErrors in the following example metrics: This scenario only happens when the default interface is eth0. Kubernetessource code has it hardcoded that eth0 is the default. In the followingexample you can see that we only have network metrics inside the interfaceslist, in this case there is no eth0 on the and the default interface is ens5: In cases like this, the integration will look for the default interfaceinside the interfaces list and use those values. The default interface nameis retrieved from the network route file (default /proc/net/route). When running the unprivileged version of the integration we don't have accessto the route file, the integration won't be able to get the default interfacename and won't send network metrics for the unless there's a networkinterface called eth0. For Pods, this issue is mainly present when using hostNetwok since theyshared the same network interfaces with the Node.",

    "description": "The Kubernetes integration v1.21.0 brings several changes related to node allocatable resources . Cluster explorer Cluster dashboard Kubernetes metrics Changes to the cluster explorer We added support for allocatable resources to the Kubernetes cluster explorer : The cluster explorer entity list now calculates CPU usage by summing the allocatableCpuCores from the K8sNodeSample instead of using processorCount from SystemSample. Similarly, memory usage is now calculated by summing allocatableMemoryBytes instead of memoryTotalBytes. Pods' columns now refer to running pods vs. allocatable pods. In addition to resource consumption, the node's tooltip in the cluster explorer now shows the amount of allocatable pods used by the node. The node card, which appears when clicking a node in cluster explorer, now shows resource consumption (CPU, memory, and storage) against the allocatable resources. CPU usage aggregates cpuUsedCores, cpuRequestedCores, and cpuLimitCores from K8sContainerSample, and allocatableCpuCores from the K8sNodeSample. Memory usage aggregates memoryWorkingSetBytes, memoryRequestedBytes, and memoryLimitBytes from K8sContainerSample, and allocatableMemoryBytes from K8sNodeSample. Storage usage relies on fsUsedBytes and fsCapacityBytes fromK8sNodeSample. A new pods widget has been added to the node card that shows the amount of pods used against the total allocatable pods of the node. If you run the unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration , you can now see the node metrics. Previously, this was only possible with the privileged version. Changes to the cluster dashboard [#clusterdashboard] The cluster explorer dashboard, which appears when clicking Kubernetes dashboard , has been updated to account for resource consumption against allocatable resources. CPU widgets displays cpuUsedCores and allocatableCpuCores from K8sNodeSample. As for Memory usage, it now shows memoryWorkingSetBytes and allocatableMemoryBytes. Disk widgets use fsUsedBytes and fsCapacityBytes from K8sNodeSample. A new pods widget has been added that shows the amount of pods used against the total allocatable pods of the cluster. Changes to Kubernetes metrics  [#k8smetrics] Node allocatable resources  and capacity are retrieved from the API server and added to the K8sNodeSample as capacity<ResourceName> and allocatable<ResourceName>. The Kubernetes server version is now retrieved from the API server and cached with the APIServerCacheK8SVersionTTL config option. The version is added to K8sClusterSample as clusterK8sVersion, and to the inventory. Add support for static pods status for Kubernetes server versions 1.15 or newer. In older versions of Kubernetes, the kubeletes wouldn’t sync  the status of the static pods with the API server and would always return a Pending status. This behavior was fixed in v1.15 of Kubernetes. Our integration now detects what version of Kubernetes the cluster is running and, if it’s 1.15 or newer, it adds the status of the static pods in K8sPodSample. Other changes We have upgraded the newrelic/infrastructure-bundle  base image to v1.3.8. For more information, see the New Relic Infrastructure Bundle release notes .",

    "description": "Notes Follow standard procedures to install  or update  the New Relic integration for Kubernetes. Changelog Added:  support for querying Kube State Metrics (KSM) instances behind kube-rbac-proxy . This feature only works when paired with the label-based KSM discovery (see release notes of version 1.11.0  for more information). This adds two new environment variables that allow deeper configuration of the feature: KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME: Whether the query should use the http or https protocols. Defaults to http and doesn't introduce a breaking change in behavior. KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT: The port in which the kube-rbac-proxy instance is listening on. You can confirm this by describing your KSM pod. Defaults to 8080 and doesn't introduce a breaking change in behavior. Added:  Added 4 new environment variables to explicitly set the control plane component base URLs. These variables can be used for Kubernetes configurations, such as OpenShift , that are different than the defaults defined in the section Discovery of master nodes and control plane components . See the section OpenShift 4.x Configuration  for more information. SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL: The base URL of the scheduler pod metrics endpoint. The default is the empty string. In this case, the default configuration  will be used. ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL: The base URL of the ETCD pod metrics endpoint. The default is the empty string. In this case, the default configuration  will be used. CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL: The base URL of the controller manager pod metrics endpoint. The default is the empty string. In this case, the default configuration  will be used. API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL: The base URL of the API server pod metrics endpoint. The default is the empty string. In this case, the default configuration  will be used. Fixed:  A bug preventing attributes named like selector.<label_name> from being added to some entries in the K8sServiceSample. Changed:  The integration now uses newrelic/infrastructure-bundle  as the base image. The tag used is for the version 1.2.0.

Still cgroup PIDs (process and thread count) is not available on Kernel versions lower than 4.3 see support . Therefore column threadCount won't be available for these systems. For instance Amazon-Linux v1 runs on kernel 4.13. Fixed permissions to /tmp/nri-integrations directory while updating the agent from root mode to privileged or unprivileged mode . This changes the owner of the /tmp/nri-integrations folder, which is used by some integrations and the Infrastructure integrations SDK  to cache data. Fixed issue when running in Kubernetes where an integration configuration change provided by ConfigMap wouldn't be picked up by the agent, breaking the hot config reload feature for integrations.",

    "description": "Notes A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to update your Infrastructure agent . Features Added IPv6 support during hostname resolution via DNS. In verbose mode, more detailed logging during hostname resolution. Bug fixes Fixed a bug from the new integrations' engine added in the version 1.8.0 , which caused any JSON line larger than 64 KB to be ignored. This does not affect to the integrations that are configured with the format prior to 1.8.0, which is still supported. Fixed ${config.path} replacement  in new integrations' configuration file. When an integration configuration contained a config or config_file_template section and the ${config.path} variable was used in an environment variable or command-line argument, the correct path was set only during the first execution, remaining the same for the rest of executions, even if the path changes. Fixed Linux packaging metadata. Updated the Vendor field from \"<jenkins@401c99d99b5f>\" to \"New Relic, Inc.\", fixing the problem that some customers where having on SLES v11.2 Suse, or higher, due to the \"repository vendor stickiness\", which protects apps from accidentally replacing stable versions of installed packages with experimental versions from a different repository when updating. Added extra metadata fields: License, Maintainer, URL, Description, Distribution and Summary",

Added Improved logging and troubleshooting features: Logging agent config options at startup (with obfuscation of sensitive data). Logging all the config options of the loaded integrations at startup (with obfuscation of sensitive data). Improve log messages related to integrations. Integrations health checks New binary called newrelic-infra-ctl for sending notifications to the agent for: Enabling verbose logs for 5 minutes Integrations health check Agent daemon notification For notifying the agent to perform actions, the newrelic-infra-ctl command was created. It has the sole responsibility of sending a notification to the agent process that's running inside the host. In Linux this communication happens via POSIX signals. newrelic-infra-ctl first tries to find if there is an agent process running. If it finds it, it checks if the process is running inside a Docker container. This is because signals to Docker containers are sent with the docker kill command. Once it knows the pid and the signaling method to use, it sends a SIGUSR1 signal to the agent. The agent just has to set a signal handler for when it receives a SIGUSR1. In Windows, things are a little different. The only signals that we could send to the process were exit signals. In Windows processes communicate by sending messages to their respective windows, but you might be wondering (as I was), the agent is a daemon process so it doesn't have a window. The solution, easy, a hidden window. On startup the agent creates a hidden window, and sets a handler that listens for messages that arrive in that window. newrelic-infra-ctl finds that windows and sends messages to it. Changed Decorate samples with reportingAgent attribute and replace loopback address if found in reportingEndpoint and reportingEntityKey samples attributes. Do not log config.pid_file property in the Windows agent.",

Features Added the dns_hostname_resolution configuration option (default: true). If set to false, the agent won't use DNS-based hostname resolution and will ask directly to the operating system. Added ignore_reclaimable configuration option (Linux only), which considers reclaimable memory as part of the free memory (and not part of the used memory). Free memory will be is calculated as: total - free - buffers - cached - sreclaimable, independently of the MemAvailable report from the kernel. Improvements In cloud environments, the instance ID retrieval process is more solid during the agent startup. It also allows the agent to be spawned from VM snapshots. Changes Removed total_cores host metric. Bug fixes Fixed a bug that caused the DiskMonitor samples to show devices in the deny list (from the file_devices_ignored configuration option). Fixed Storage Sampler in 32-bit Windows agent. Reduced the incidence of hostname flipping in DNS-based hostname resolution. Fixed a bug that, in the Linux agent, removed the last character of the command line of some process samples. (Linux only) Fixed the used memory values in the System Samples, which in agent 1.2.1 were slightly different from the actual value. Fixed a problem that, when an environment configuration option had a wrong format, caused the rest of the environment variables to not be parsed.",

    "description": "Notes A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to update your Infrastructure agent . Fixed PR-50  Fixed inventory deltas submission for remote (non host) entities. This fixes inventory errors showing up on the log for DEBUG level with message error field deltas not in expected order: have delta ID XXX, want YYY. Context Inventory deltas are JSON diffs and they need to be applied in order aiming to provide a consistent state. Both the infrastructure agent and the New Relic database stored their latest delta ID  received/submitted. This delta ID is incremented in each plugin entity inventory submission to New Relic. When these IDs go out of sync between agent and platform, the latter provides its latest known ID  for the given inventory plugin and entity. Then a reconciliation process is run by the agent for that plugin so that the next ID  will match the one expected by New Relic. Root cause For remote, non-host entities the agent side didn't store delta IDs on a per-entity basis as the New Relic database did. This means that for a given inventory plugin or integration providing more than 1 entity there'd be delta ID order  issues, which were only seen on agent's DEBUG level (verbose mode > 0). At some point all data would usually be submitted as reconciliation process attempts to fix this. But for high load integrations producing multiple remote entities this reconciliation process would be triggered every time an entity needs to be submitted as for each of them platform keeps a record, while the agent recorded ID on a per-plugin basis. Therefore, for high-load integrations, the agent reconciliation process might enter in race-condition loop when trying to fix the delta IDs. Fix This release fixes this behaviour by keeping track of delta IDs in the same way as the New Relic database does (or a per-plugin, per-entity basis). As state might be stored on disk for inventory deltas, if any integration had it persisted before the fix it'll take a reconciliation run per entity to fix agent's locally stored IDs. In this case you might still see some log entries, but they'll be gone during their first submissions.",

Feature: Serverless Mode for AWS Lambda The Ruby agent is now capable of operating in a quick and light serverless mode suitable for observing AWS Lambda function invocations. For serverless use, the agent is delivered by a New Relic Lambda layer  that can be associated with a Lambda function. All reported data will appear in New Relic's dedicated serverless UI views. Only AWS based Lambda functions are supported for now, though support for other cloud hosted serverless offerings may be added in future depending on Ruby customer demand. The serverless functionality is only intended for use with the official New Relic Ruby layers for Lambda. Any existing workflows that involve the manual use of the Ruby agent in an AWS Lambda context without a New Relic layer should not be impacted. Feature: Add support for Elasticsearch 8.13.0 Elasticsearch 8.13.0 increased the number of arguments used in the method the agent instruments, Elastic::Transport::Client#perform_request. Now, the agent supports a variable number of arguments for the instrumented method to prevent future ArgumentErrors. Bugfix: Add 'request.temperature' to ruby-openai chat completion summaries Previously, the agent was not reporting the request.temperature attribute on LlmChatCompletionSummary events through ruby-openai instrumentation.

Read more about keeping agents up to date . See the New Relic Ruby agent EOL policy  for information about agent releases and support dates. v9.8.0 Version 9.8.0 introduces instrumentation for ruby-openai, adds the option to store tracer state on the thread-level, hardens the browser agent insertion logic to better proactively anticipate errors, and prevents excpetions from being raised in the Active Support Broadcast logger instrumentation. Feature: Add instrumentation for ruby-openai Instrumentation has been added for the ruby-openai  gem, supporting versions 3.4.0 and higher (PR#2442) . While ruby-openai instrumentation is enabled by default, the configuration option ai_monitoring.enabled is disabled by default and controls all AI monitoring. ai_monitoring.enabled must be set to true in order to receive ruby-openai instrumentation. High-Security Mode must be disabled in order to receive AI monitoring. Calls to embedding and chat completion endpoints are automatically traced. These events can be enhanced with the introduction of two new APIs. Custom attributes can also be added to LLM events using the API NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes, but they must be prefixed with llm.. For example, NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({'llm.user_id': user_id}). Feature: Add AI monitoring APIs This version introduces two new APIs that allow users to record additional information on LLM events: NewRelic::Agent.record_llm_feedback_event - Records user feedback events. NewRelic::Agent.set_llm_token_count_callback - Sets a callback proc for calculating token_count attributes for embedding and chat completion message events. Visit RubyDoc  for more information on each of these APIs. Feature: Store tracer state on thread-level A new configuration option, thread_local_tracer_state, stores New Relic's tracer state on the thread-level, as opposed to the default fiber-level storage. This configuration is turned off by default. Our thanks go to community member @markiz  who contributed the idea, code, configuration option, and tests for this new feature! PR#2475 . Bugfix: Harden the browser agent insertion logic With Issue#2462 , community member @miry  explained that it was possible for an HTTP response headers hash to have symbols for values. Not only would these symbols prevent the inclusion of the New Relic browser agent tag in the response body, but more importantly they would cause an exception that would bubble up to the monitored web application itself. With PR#2465  symbol based values are now supported and all other potential future exceptions are now handled. Additionally, the refactor to support symbols has been shown through benchmarking to give the processing of string and mixed type hashes a slight speed boost too. Bugfix: Prevent Exception in Active Support Broadcast logger instrumentation Previously, in certain situations the agent could cause an exception to be raised when attempting to interact with a broadcast log event. This has been fixed. Thanks to @nathan-appere  for reporting this issue and providing a fix! PR#2510",

Feature: ViewComponent instrumentation ViewComponent  is a now an instrumented library. PR#2367 Feature: Use root path to access Elasticsearch cluster name Previously, the agent used the cluster health endpoint (/_cluster/health) to access the cluster name.

Our thanks go to @erikkessler1 , @gremerritt , and @joshbranham  for reporting the issue, suggesting solutions, and testing them. Issue#2360  PR#2377 Feature: Remove base64 dependency, use direct calls to String methods In version 9.6.0, the agent required the Ruby base64 gem as a depdendency to prepare for deprecation warnings in Ruby 3.3 and the gem's removal from the Ruby standard libraries in 3.4. Including base64 as a dependency has caused problems with version resolution in some environments. To resolve this, the agent now directly calls the String methods used in the base64 library in the new NewRelic::Base64 module. Thank you, @Earlopain , for submitting this change. PR#2378 Feature: Add Falcon support The agent now supports the web server Falcon . PR#2383 Feature: Remove spans with name Ruby/Thread and Ruby/Fiber Due to the lack of helpful information and the confusion commonly caused by the spans named Ruby/Thread and Ruby/Fiber, these spans have been removed. However, the agents ability to monitor instrumented code running in a thread or fiber will remain unchanged. PR#2389",

Feature: Add instrumentation for Async::HTTP The agent will now record spans for Async::HTTP requests. Versions 0.59.0 and above of the async-http gem are supported. PR#2272 Feature: Add instrumentation for Ethon Instrumentation has been added for the Ethon  HTTP client gem. Versions 0.12.0 and above are supported. The agent will now record external request segments for invocations of Ethon::Easy#perform and Ethon::Multi#perform. NOTE: The Typhoeus  gem is maintained by the same team that maintains Ethon and depends on Ethon for its functionality. To prevent duplicate reporting for each HTTP request, the Ethon instrumentation will be disabled when Typhoeus is detected. PR#2260 Feature: Add instrumentation for HTTPX The agent now offers instrumentation for the HTTP client HTTPX , provided the gem is at version 1.0.0 or above. PR#2278 Feature: Prevent the agent from starting in \"rails\" commands in Rails 7 Previously, the agent ignored many Rails commands by default, such as rails routes, using Rake-specific logic. This was accomplished by setting these commands as default values for the config option autostart.denylisted_rake_tasks. However, Rails 7 no longer uses Rake for these commands, causing the agent to start running and attempting to record data when running these commands. The commands have now been added to the default value for the config option autostart.denylisted_constants, which will allow the agent to recognize these commands correctly in Rails 7 and prevent the agent from starting during ignored tasks. Note that the agent will continue to start-up when the rails server and rails runner commands are invoked. PR#2239 Feature: Glean Docker container ID for cgroups v2-based containers Previously, the agent was only capable of determining a host Docker container's ID if the container was based on cgroups v1. Now, containers based on cgroups v2 will also have their container IDs reported to New Relic. PR#2229 . Feature: Update events with additional synthetics attributes when available The agent will now record additional synthetics attributes on synthetics events if these attributes are available.  PR#2203 Feature: Declare a gem dependency on the Ruby Base 64 gem 'base64' For compatibility with Ruby 3.4 and to silence compatibility warnings present in Ruby 3.3, declare a dependency on the base64 gem. The New Relic Ruby agent uses the native Ruby base64 gem for Base 64 encoding/decoding. The agent is joined by Ruby on Rails (rails/rails@3e52adf ) and others in making this change in preparation for Ruby 3.3/3.4. PR#2238 Feature: Add Roda support for the newrelic_ignore* family of methods The agent can now selectively disable instrumentation for particular requests within Roda applications. Supported methods include: newrelic_ignore: ignore a given route. newrelic_ignore_apdex: exclude a given route from consideration in overall Apdex calculations. newrelic_ignore_enduser: prevent automatic injection of the page load timing JavaScript when a route is rendered. For more information, see Roda Instrumentation . PR#2267 Feature: Add additional span attributes for OpenTelemetry compatibility For improved compatibility with OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions, the agent's datastore (for databases) and external request (for HTTP clients) segments have been updated with additional attributes. Datastore segments now offer 3 additional attributes: db.system: The database system. For Ruby we use the database adapter name here. server.address: The database host. server.port: The database port. External request segments now offer 3 additional attributes: http.request.method: The HTTP method (ex: 'GET') server.address: The target host. server.port: The target port. For maximum backwards compatibility, no existing attributes have been renamed or removed. PR#2283 Bugfix: Stop sending duplicate log events for Rails 7.1 users Rails 7.1 introduced the public API ActiveSupport::BroadcastLogger .

See the New Relic Ruby agent EOL policy  for information about agent releases and support dates. v9.5.0 Version 9.5.0 introduces Stripe instrumentation, allows the agent to record additional response information on a transaction when middleware instrumentation is disabled, introduces new :'sidekiq.args.include' and :'sidekiq.args.exclude: configuration options to permit capturing only certain Sidekiq job arguments, updates Elasticsearch datastore instance metrics, and fixes a bug in NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks.needed?. Feature: Add Stripe instrumentation Stripe  calls are now automatically instrumented. Additionally, new :'stripe.user_data.include' and :'stripe.user_data.exclude' configuration options permit capturing custom user_data key-value pairs that can be stored in Stripe events . No user_data key-value pairs are captured by default. The agent currently supports Stripe versions 5.38.0+. PR#2180 Feature: Report transaction HTTP status codes when middleware instrumentation is disabled Previously, when disable_middleware_instrumentation was set to true, the agent would not record the value of the response code or content type on the transaction. This was due to the possibility that a middleware could alter the response, which would not be captured by the agent when the middleware instrumentation was disabled. However, based on customer feedback, the agent will now report the HTTP status code and content type on a transaction when middleware instrumentation is disabled. PR#2175 Feature: Permit capturing only certain Sidekiq job arguments New :'sidekiq.args.include' and :'sidekiq.args.exclude' configuration options have been introduced to permit fine grained control over which Sidekiq job arguments (args) are reported to New Relic. By default, no Sidekiq args are reported. To report any Sidekiq options, the :'attributes.include' array must include the string 'jobs.sidekiq.args.*'. With that string in place, all arguments will be reported unless one or more of the new include/exclude options are used. The :'sidekiq.args.include' option can be set to an array of strings. Each of those strings will be passed to Regexp.new and collectively serve as an allowlist for desired args. For job arguments that are hashes, if a hash's key matches one of the include patterns, then both the key and its corresponding value will be included. For scalar arguments, the string representation of the scalar will need to match one of the include patterns to be captured. The :'sidekiq.args.exclude' option works similarly. It can be set to an array of strings that will each be passed to Regexp.new to create patterns. These patterns will collectively serve as a denylist for unwanted job args. Any hash key, hash value, or scalar that matches an exclude pattern will be excluded (not sent to New Relic). PR#2177 newrelic.yml examples: Any string in the :'sidekiq.args.include' or :'sidekiq.args.exclude' arrays will be turned into a regular expression. Knowledge of Ruby regular expression support  can be leveraged but is not required. If regular expression syntax is not used, inexact matches will be performed and the string \"Fortune\" will match both \"Fortune 500\" and \"Fortune and Glory\". For exact matches, use regular expression anchors . Bugfix: Update Elasticsearch datastore instance metric to use port instead of path Previously, the Elasticsearch datastore instance metric (Datastore/instance/Elasticsearch/<host>/*) used the path as the final value. This caused a metrics grouping issue  for some users, as every document ID created a unique metric. Now, the datastore instance metric has been updated to use the port as the final value. This also has the benefit of being more accurate for datastore instance metrics, as this port is directly associated with the already listed host. Bugfix: Resolve inverted logic of NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks.needed? Previously, NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks.needed? incorrectly used inverted logic. This has now been resolved, allowing AgentHooks to be installed when disable_middleware_instrumentation is set to true. PR#2175",

Read more about keeping agents up to date . See the New Relic Ruby agent EOL policy  for information about agent releases and support dates. v9.2.0 Version 9.2.0 of the agent introduces some performance improvements for working with high numbers of nested actions, and deprecates instrumentation for the memcached and memcache-client gems (with dalli still being supported). Feature: Enhance performance for handling high numbers of nested actions With Issue#1910 , community members @parkerfinch  and @travisbell  informed us of some CPU spikes and process hangs seen only when using the agent's thread instrumentation, which was enabled by default with v9.0. When thread instrumentation is enabled, instrumented actions taking place within threads are seen and reported on by the agent whereas they would have previously gone unnoticed. This is a great improvement to the agent's usefulness in an async context, and also makes it easier for higher numbers of nested actions to be observed.\nFor example, if an instrumented background job framework (Sidekiq, Resque) kicks off a job that the agent notices and then that job in turn performs actions such as database queries that the agent also instruments, nested actions are seen. However, with very high (10,000+) numbers of actions nested within a single instrumented outer action, the agent would struggle to efficiently crunch through all of the collected data at the time when the outer action finished.\nThe agent should now be much more efficient when any observed action with lots of nested actions is finished. Our performance testing was conducted with hundreds of thousands of nested actions taking place, and we hope that the benefits of thread tracing can now be enjoyed without any drawbacks. Thanks very much @parkerfinch  and @travisbell !

PR#3018 Feature: Add health checks when the agent runs within Agent Control When the agent is started within an Agent Control  environment, a health check file will be created at the configured file location for every agent process. By default, this location is: '/newrelic/apm/health'. The health check files will be updated at the configured frequency, which defaults to every five seconds. PR#2995 Feature: Add Redshift as recognized ActiveRecord adapter When the agent does not recognize an ActiveRecord adapter, the host, port, and database name information is not added to the datastore span. Redshift will now be treated like PostgreSQL, and the agent will save the host, port, and database name on the span. PR#3032 Feature: Add instrumentation for aws-sdk-kinesis The agent now has instrumentation for the aws-sdk-kinesis  gem. It will record message broker segments for get_records, put_record, and put_records operations. All other operations will record standard segments. PR#2974 Bugfix: Stop emitting inaccurate debug-level log about deprecated configuration options In the previous major release, we dropped support for many disable_library_name configuration options in favor of instrumentation.library_name. Previously, a DEBUG level log warning appeared whenever disable_* options were set to true, even for libraries (e.g. Action Dispatch) without equivalent instrumentation.* options: This inaccurate warning has been removed. If you are disabling instrumentation using instrumentation.library_name: disabled or NEW_RELIC_INSTRUMENTATION_LIBRARY_NAME=disabled, please verify the option exists by consulting our configuration documentation . If the option does not exist, check the 'Disabling' section  to see if there is a related option. We apologize for the confusion. PR#3005 Bugfix: Do not attempt to decorate logs with nil messages The agent no longer attempts to add New Relic linking metadata to logs with nil messages. Thank you, @arlando  for bringing this to our attention! Issue#2985  PR#2986 Bugfix: Stop renaming final Grape segment Previously, the agent renamed the final segment in Grape transactions to \"Middleware/Grape/#{class_name}/call\". This was a part of an old instrumentation pattern that is no longer relevant. Many thanks to @seriousdev-gh  for bringing this issue to our attention and along with a great reproduction and suggested fix. PR#2987 .",

PR#2956 Bugfix: Record explain plan traces on Rails 7.2+ Rails 7.2 removed adapter-specific connection methods (ex. ActiveRecord::Base.postgresql_connection) and replaced them with ActiveRecord::Base.with_connection. Our explain plan feature relies on making a connection to the database to create an explain plan trace. Due to a bug in our tests, we missed this regression.

Feature: New configuration option cloud.aws.account_id A new configuration option has been added, cloud.aws.account_id, that will allow New Relic to provide more details about certain calls made using the AWS SDK. For example, relationships between AWS services instrumented with New Relic's CloudWatch Metric Streams will have relationships formed in the service map with APM applications. Currently, the DynamoDB instrumentation is the only instrumentation that will make use of this configuration option, but this will be used in future instrumentation as well. PR#2904 Feature: Use default View/component metric name for unidentified View Components Previously, when a View Component metric name could not be identified, the agent would set the name as nil. Now, the agent defaults to using View/component as the metric name when one can not be identified. PR#2907 Bugfix: Instrumentation errors when using the karafka-rdkafka gem Due to version differences between the rdkafka gem and karafka-rdkafka gem, the agent could encounter an error when it tried to install rdkafka instrumentation.

Feature: Add Apache Kafka instrumentation for the rdkafka and ruby-kafka gems The agent now has instrumentation for both the rdkafka and ruby-kafka gems. The agent will record transactions and message broker segments for produce and consume calls made using these gems. PR#2824  PR#2842 Feature: Add a configuration option to permit custom method tracers to be defined automatically A new :automatic_custom_instrumentation_method_list configuration parameter has been added to permit the user to define a list of fully qualified (namespaced) Ruby methods for the agent to automatically add custom instrumentation for without requiring any code modifications to be made to the classes that define the methods. The list should be an array of CLASS#METHOD (for instance methods) and/or CLASS.METHOD (for class methods) strings. Use fully qualified class names (using the :: delimiter) that include any module or class namespacing. Here is some Ruby source code that defines a render_png instance method for an Image class and a notify class method for a User class, both within a MyCompany module namespace: Given that source code, the newrelic.yml config file might request instrumentation for both of these methods like so: That configuration example uses YAML array syntax to specify both methods. Alternatively, a comma-delimited string can be used instead: Whitespace around the comma(s) in the list is optional. When configuring the agent with a list of methods via the NEW_RELIC_AUTOMATIC_CUSTOM_INSTRUMENTATION_METHOD_LIST environment variable, this comma-delimited string format should be used: PR#2851 Feature: Collect just MIME type for ActionDispatch 7.0+ requests Rails 7.0 introduced changes  to the behavior of ActionDispatch::Request#content_type, adding extra request-related details the agent wasn't expecting to collect. Additionally, the agent's use of content_type  was triggering deprecation warnings. The agent now uses ActionDispatch::Request#media_type to capture the MIME type. Thanks to @internethostage  for letting us know about this change. Issue#2500  PR#2855 Bugfix: Corrected Boolean coercion for newrelic.yml configuration Previously, any String assigned to New Relic configurations expecting a Boolean value were evaluated as true. This could lead to unexpected behavior. For example, setting application_logging.enabled: 'false' in newrelic.yml would incorrectly evaluate to application_logging.enabled: true due to the truthy nature of Strings. Now, the agent strictly interprets Boolean configuration values. It recognizes both actual Boolean values and certain Strings/Symbols: 'true', 'yes', or 'on' (evaluates to true) 'false', 'no', or 'off' (evaluates to false) Any other inputs will revert to the setting's default configuration value. PR#2847 Bugfix: JRuby not saving configuration values correctly in configuration manager Previously, a change made to fix a different JRuby bug caused the agent to not save configuration values correctly in the configuration manager when running on JRuby. This has been fixed. PR#2848 Bugfix: Update condition to verify Bundler.rubygems.installed_specs is available To address a recent Bundler deprecation warning, we started using Bundler.rubygems.installed_specs instead of Bundler.rubygems.all_specs in environments that seemed appropriate. We discovered the version constraint we used was too low. Now, rather than check the version, we check for the method using respond_to?. PR#2853 Bugfix: Support view_component v3.15.0+ Previously the agent had been making use of a private API to obtain a component identifier value. This private API was dropped in v3.15.0 of view_component, resulting in errors from the New Relic Ruby agent's continued attempts to use it.

Feature: Enhance AWS Lambda function instrumentation When utilized via the latest New Relic Ruby layer for AWS Lambda , the agent now offers enhanced support for AWS Lambda function instrumentation. The agent's instrumentation for AWS Lambda functions now supports distributed tracing. Web-triggered invocations are now identified as being \"web\"-based when an API Gateway call is involved, with support for both API Gateway versions 1.0 and 2.0. Web-based calls have the HTTP method, URI, and status code recorded. The agent now recognizes and reports on 12 separate AWS resources that are capable of triggering a Lambda function invocation: ALB, API Gateway V1, API Gateway V2, CloudFront, CloudWatch Scheduler, DynamoStreams, Firehose, Kinesis, S3, SES, SNS, and SQS. The type of the triggering resource and its ARN will be recorded for each resource, and for many of them, extra resource-specific attributes will be recorded as well. For example, Lambda function invocations triggered by S3 bucket activity will now result in the S3 bucket name being recorded.\nPR#2811 Feature: Add experimental OpenSearch instrumentation The agent will now automatically instrument the opensearch-ruby gem. We're marking this instrumentation as experimental because more work is needed to fully test it. OpenSearch instrumentation provides telemetry similar to Elasticsearch. Thank you, @Earlopain  for reporting the issue and @praveen-ks  for an initial draft of the instrumentation. Issue#2228  PR#2796 Feature: Improve framework detection accuracy for Grape and Padrino Previously, applications using the Grape framework would set ruby as their framework within the Environment Report. Now, Grape applications will be set to grape. Similarly, applications using the Padrino framework would be set to sinatra. Now, they will be set to padrino. This will help the New Relic security agent compatibility checks. Thank you, @prateeksen  for making this change. Issue#2777  PR#2789 Feature: Silence Bundler all_specs deprecation warning Bundler.rubygems.all_specs was deprecated in favor of Bundler.rubygems.installed_specs in Bundler versions 2+, causing the agent to emit deprecation warnings. The method has been updated when Bundler 2+ is detected and warnings are now silenced. Thanks to @jcoyne  for reporting this issue. Issue#2733  PR#2823 Bugfix: Fix Falcon dispatcher detection Previously, we tried to use the object space to determine whether the Falcon web server  was in use. However, Falcon is not added to the object space until after the environment report is generated, resulting in a nil dispatcher. Now, we revert to an earlier strategy that discovered the dispatcher using File.basename. Thank you, @prateeksen  for reporting this issue and researching the problem. Issue#2778  PR#2795 Bugfix: Fix for a Redis instrumentation error when Redis::Cluster::Client is present The Redis instrumentation previously contained a bug that would cause it to error out when Redis::Cluster::Client was present, owing to the use of a Ruby return outside of a method. Thanks very much to @jdelStrother  for not only reporting this bug but pointing us to the root cause as well. Issue#2814  PR#2816 Bugfix: Address JRuby concurrency issue with config hash accessing The agent's internal configuration class maintains a hash that occassionally gets rebuilt. During the rebuild, certain previously dynamically determined instrumentation values are preserved for the benefit of the New Relic Ruby security agent . After reports from JRuby customers regarding concurrency issues related to the hash being accessed while being modified, two separate fixes went into the hash rebuild logic previously: a Hash#dup operation and a synchronize do block. But errors were still reported. We ourselves remain unable to reproduce these concurrency errors despite using the same exact versions of JRuby and all reported software. After confirming that the hash access code in question is only needed for the Ruby security agent (which operates only in non-production dedicated security testing environments), we have introduced a new fix for JRuby customers that will simply skip over the troublesome code when JRuby is in play but the security agent is not.

Feature: Add support for the newrelic_security agent New Relic Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)  can help you prevent cyberattacks and breaches on your applications by probing your running code for exploitable vulnerabilities. The newrelic_security gem provides this feature for Ruby. It depends on newrelic_rpm. This is the first version of newrelic_rpm compatible with newrelic_security. At this time, the security agent is intended for use only within a dedicated security testing environment with data that can tolerate modification or deletion. The security agent is available as a separate Ruby gem, newrelic_security. It is recommended that this separate gem only be introduced to a security testing environment by leveraging Bundler grouping like so: In order to run the security agent, you need to update your configuration. At a minimum, security.agent.enabled and security.enabled must be set to true. They are false by default. Similar to the gem installation, we recommend you set these configurations for a special security testing environment only.

PR#2559 Feature: Add instrumentation for redis-clustering Version 5.x of the redis gem moved cluster behavior into a different gem, redis-clustering. This gem can access instrumentation registered through RedisClient::Middleware. Previously, the agent only instrumented the call_pipelined method through this approach, but now users of the redis-clustering gem will also have instrumentation registered for connect and call methods. In addition, the way the database_name attribute is set for Redis datastore spans is now compatible with all versions of Redis supported by the New Relic Ruby agent.

Feature: Add instrumentation for SQS The agent has added instrumentation for the aws-sdk-sqs gem . The agent will now record message broker spans for SQS client calls made with the aws-sdk-sqs gem. PR#2679 Bugfix: HTTP status code based expected errors will now have an \"expected\" value of \"true\" Previously when an error was treated as expected by the agent as a result of a matching HTTP status code being found in the :'error_collector.expected_status_codes' configuration setting, the error would not appear with an \"expected\" attribute value of \"true\" in the errors in the errors inbox. PR#2710 Bugfix: Stripe metric names will no longer include full request paths to limit the unique name count The Stripe instrumentation introduced in agent version v9.5.0 produced instrumentation metric names that used the full Stripe request path. For any significant Stripe usage, this could quickly lead to very large number of distinct metric names. Now only the API version and the category part of the request path are included in the metric name which still includes the \"Stripe\" opener and method (ex: \"get\") closer. Thanks to @jdelStrother  and @jsneedles  for bringing this issue to our attention and providing terrific information explaining the problem and potential paths to resolution. PR#2716",

Bugfix: DynamoDB instrumentation logging errors when trying to get account_id When trying to access data needed to add the account_id to the DynamoDB span, the agent encountered an error when certain credentials classes were used.

The inclusion of Rails::Command::RakeCommand prevented the agent from starting automatically when Solid Queue was started using bin/rails solid_queue:start. We recognize there are many commands nested within Rails::Command::RakeCommand and have decided to remove it from the default list. We encourage users who do not want the agent to run on Rails::Command::RakeCommand to add the constant to their configuration.

Read more about keeping agents up to date . See the New Relic Ruby agent EOL policy  for information about agent releases and support dates. v9.10.0 Version 9.10.0 introduces instrumentation for DynamoDB, adds a new feature to automatically apply nonces from the Rails content security policy, fixes a bug that would cause an expected error to negatively impact a transaction's Apdex, and fixes the agent's autostart logic so that by default rails runner and rails db commands will not cause the agent to start. Feature: Add instrumentation for DynamoDB The agent has added instrumentation for the aws-sdk-dynamodb gem. The agent will now record datastore spans for DynamoDB client calls made with the aws-sdk-dynamodb gem.  PR#2642 Feature: Automatically apply nonces from the Rails content security policy To auto-inject browser monitoring with the New Relic Ruby agent, you either need to set your content security policy to 'unsafe-inline' or provide a nonce. Previously, the only way to provide a nonce was by using the NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header  API. Now, when a Rails application uses the content security policy configuration to add a nonce , the nonce will be automatically applied to the browser agent. A new configuration option, browser_monitoring.content_security_policy_nonce , toggles this feature. It is on by default. Thank you @baldarn  for submitting this feature! PR#2544 Bugfix: Expected errors related to HTTP status code, class, and message won't impact Apdex The agent is supposed to prevent observed application errors from negatively impacting Apdex if the errors are either ignored or expected. There are two ways for the agent to expect an error: via the notice_error API receiving an expected: true argument or via matches made against user-configured lists for expected HTTP status codes (:'error_collector.expected_status_codes'), expected error classes (:'error_collector.expected_classes'), or expected error messages (:'error_collector.expected_messages'). Previously, only errors expected via the notice_error API were correctly prevented from impacting Apdex. Expected errors set by configuration incorrectly impacted Apdex. This behavior has been fixed and now both types of expected errors will correctly not impact Apdex. Thanks very much to @florianpilz  for bringing this issue to our attention. PR#2619 Bugfix: Do not start the agent automatically when rails runner or rails db commands are run PR#2239  taught the agent how to recognize bin/rails based contexts that it should not automatically start up in. But bin/rails runner and bin/rails db commands would still see the agent start automatically. Those 2 contexts will now no longer see the agent start automatically. Thank you to @jdelStrother  for both bringing the bin/rails context to our attention and for letting us know about the bin/rails runner and bin/rails db outliers that still needed fixing.

Read more about keeping agents up to date . See the New Relic Ruby agent EOL policy  for information about agent releases and support dates. v9.1.0 Version 9.1.0 of the agent delivers support for two new errors inbox  features: error fingerprinting and user tracking, identifies the Amazon Timestream data store, removes Distributed Tracing warnings from agent logs when using Sidekiq, fixes bugs, and is tested against the recently released JRuby 9.4.2.0. Feature: Error fingerprinting - supply your own errors inbox group names Are your error occurrences grouped poorly? Set your own error fingerprint via a callback function. A new set_error_group_callback public API method has been added that will accept a user defined proc. The proc will be invoked for each noticed error and whenever it returns a string, that string will be used as the error group name for the error and will take precedence over any server-side grouping that takes place with the New Relic errors inbox. This gives users much greater control over the grouping of their errors. The customer defined proc will be expected to receive exactly one input argument, a hash. The hash contains the following: | Key                  | Value                                                                        |\n| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| :error             | The Ruby error class instance. Offers #class, #message, and #backtrace |\n| :customAttributes  | Any customer defined custom attributes for the current transaction           |\n| :'request.uri'     | The current request URI if available                                         |\n| :'http.statusCode' | The HTTP status code (200, 404, etc.) if available                           |\n| :'http.method'     | The HTTP method (GET, PUT, etc.) if available                                |\n| :'error.expected'  | Whether (true) or not (false) the error was expected                         |\n| :'options'         | The options hash passed to NewRelic::Agent.notice_error                    | The callback only needs to be set once per initialization of the New Relic agent. Example usage: Feature: User tracking - associate errors with a user id You can now see the number of users impacted by an error group. Identify the end user with a new set_user_id public API method that will accept a string representation of a user id and associate that user id with the current transaction. Transactions and errors will then have a new enduser.id agent attribute associated with them. This will allow agent users to tag transactions and errors as belonging to given user ids in support of greater filtering and alerting capabilities. Identify Amazon Timestream when the amazon_timestream AR adapter is used When the agent sees the activerecord-amazon-timestream-adapter  gem being used, it will now identify the data store as \"Timestream\". Thanks very much to @wagner  for contributing this enhancement! PR#1872 Bugfix: Remove Distributed Tracing related warnings from agent logs when headers are not present in Sidekiq Previously, the agent would log a warning to newrelic_agent.log every time it attempted to accept empty Distributed Tracing headers from Sidekiq jobs which could result in an excessive number of warnings. Now the agent will no longer create these warnings when using Sidekiq. PR#1834 Bugfix: Log request headers in debug-level logs instead of human-readable Objects Previously, the agent sometimes received children of the NewRelic::Agent::HTTPClients::AbstractRequest class as an argument when NewRelic::Agent::Transaction::DistributedTracers#log_request_headers was called. This caused debug-level log messages that print the request headers to show human-readable Objects (ex. #<NewRelic::Agent::HTTPClients::HTTPClientRequest:0x00007fd0dda983e0>) instead of the request headers. Now, the hash of the request headers should always be logged. PR#1839 Bugfix: Fix undefined method controller_path logged in Action Controller Instrumentation Previously, the agent could log an error when trying to determine the metric name in the Action Controller instrumentation if the controller class did not respond to controller_path. This has been resolved and the agent will no longer call this method unless the class responds to it. Thank you to @gsar  for letting us know about this issue. PR#1844 Bugfix: Fix Transaction#finish exception and decrease log level for related warning during async transactions Previously, the agent would raise a non-fatal error when a segment without a parent was unfinished when the transaction completed. This error was raised while constructing a warn-level log message. Now that Thread instrumentation is on by default, this log message emits more frequently and is less concerning. …",

Bugfix: Infinite Tracing hung on connection restart Previously, when using infinite tracing, the agent would intermittently encounter a deadlock when attempting to restart the infinite tracing connection. This bug would prevent the agent from sending all data types, including non-infinite-tracing-related data. This change reworks how we restart Infinite Tracing to prevent potential deadlocks.

    "description": "v8.8.0 Support Makara database adapters with ActiveRecord Thanks to a community submission from lucasklaassen with PR #1177 , the Ruby agent will now correctly work well with the Makara gem . Functionality such as SQL obfuscation should now work when Makara database adapters are used with Active Record. Lowered the minimum payload size to compress Previously the Ruby agent used a particularly large payload size threshold of 64KiB that would need to be met before the agent would compress data en route to New Relic's collector. The original value stems from segfault issues that very old Rubies (older than 2.2) used to encounter when compressing smaller payloads. This value has been lowered to 2KiB (2048 bytes), which should provide a more optimal balance between the CPU cycles spent on compression and the bandwidth savings gained from it. Provide Code Level Metrics for New Relic CodeStream For Ruby on Rails applications and/or those with manually traced methods, the agent is now capable of reporting metrics with Ruby method-level granularity. When the new code_level_metrics.enabled configuration parameter is set to a true value, the agent will associate source-code-related metadata with the metrics for things such as Rails controller methods. Then, when the corresponding Ruby class file that defines the methods is loaded up in a New Relic CodeStream -powered IDE, the four golden signals  for each method will be presented to the developer directly. Supportability Metrics will always report uncompressed payload size New Relic's agent specifications call for Supportability Metrics to always reference the uncompressed payload byte size. Previously, the Ruby agent was calculating the byte size after compression. Furthermore, compression is only performed on payloads of a certain size. This means that sometimes the value could have represented a compressed size and sometimes an uncompressed one. Now the uncompressed value is always used, bringing consistency for comparing two instances of the same metric and alignment with the New Relic agent specifications.

That fix has been replicated by the agent team with permission. See Issue 1033  for more details. Improve the usage of the 'hostname' executable and other executables In all places where a call to an executable binary is made (currently this is done only for the 'hostname' and 'uname' binaries), leverage a new helper method when making the call. This new helper will a) not attempt to execute the binary if it cannot be found, and b) prevent STDERR/STDOUT content from appearing anywhere except New Relic's own logs if the New Relic logger is set to the 'debug' level. When calling 'hostname', fall back to Socket.gethostname if the 'hostname' binary cannot be found. When calling 'uname', fall back on using a value of 'unknown' if the 'uname' command fails. Many thanks to @metaskills and @brcarp for letting us know that Ruby AWS Lambda functions can't invoke 'hostname' and for providing ideas and feedback with Issue #697 .

    "description": "v8.3.0 Updated the agent to support Ruby 3.1.0 Most of the changes involved updating the multiverse suite to exclude runs for older versions of instrumented gems that are not compatible with Ruby 3.1.0. In addition, Infinite Tracing testing was updated to accommodate YAML::unsafe_load for Psych 4 support. Bugfix: Update AdaptiveSampler#sampled? algorithm One of the clauses in AdaptiveSampler#sampled? would always return false due to Integer division returning a result of zero. This method has been updated to use Float division instead, to exponentially back off the number of samples required. This may increase the number of traces collected for transactions. A huge thank you to @romul for bringing this to our attention and breaking down the problem! Bugfix: Correctly encode ASCII-8BIT log messages The encoding update for the DecoratingLogger in v8.2.0 did not account for ASCII-8BIT encoded characters qualifying as valid_encoding?. Now, ASCII-8BIT characters will be encoded as UTF-8 and include replacement characters as needed. We're very grateful for @nikajukic's collaboration and submission of a test case to resolve this issue.

As of this release, the oldest supported version is 6.8.0.359 v8.14.0 Version 8.14.0 of the agent restores desired Capistrano-based changelog lookup functionality when a deployment is performed, speeds up GUID generation, delivers support for instrumenting Rails custom event notifications, fixes potential compatibility issues with the RedisClient gem, and fixes bugs related to initialization in Rails. Deployment Recipe: Restore desired Capistrano-based changelog lookup behavior The New Relic Ruby agent offers a Capistrano recipe for recording app deployments . The recipe code was significantly cleaned up with PR#1498  which inadvertently changed the way the recipe handles the changelog for a deployment. Community member @arthurwozniak  spotted and corrected this change in order to restore the desired changelog lookup functionality while retaining all of the previous cleanup. Thank you very much for your contribution, @arthurwozniak ! PR#1653 Speed up GUID generation The agent leverages random numbers in its GUID (globally unique identifier) generation and would previously always freshly calculate the result of 16^16 or 32^32 before generating a random number. Given that those 16^16 and 32^32 operations are expected, it makes sense to calculate their results up front and store them in constants to be referred to later. Doing so has resulted in a performance gain for the generation of GUIDs. Many thanks to @tungmq  for contributing this optimisation and the benchmarks to support it! PR#1693 Support for Rails ActiveSupport::Notifications for custom events When the new active_support_custom_events_names configuration parameter is set equal to an array of custom event names to subscribe to, the agent will now subscribe to each of the names specified and report instrumentation for the events when they take place. Creating custom events  is simple and now reporting instrumentation for them to New Relic is simple as well. PR#1659 Bugfix: Support older versions of the RedisClient gem, handle unknown Redis database index With version 8.13.0 of the agent, support was added for the redis-rb  gem v5+ and the new RedisClient  gem. With versions of RedisClient older than v0.11, the agent could cause the monitored application to crash when attempting to determine the Redis database index. Version 8.14.0 adds two related improvements. Firstly, support for RedisClient versions older than v0.11 has been added to get at the database index value. Secondly, the agent will no longer crash or impact the monitored application in the event that the database index cannot be obtained. Thank you very much to our community members @mbsmartee  and @patatepartie  for bringing this issue to our attention, for helping us determine how to best reproduce it, and for testing out the update. We appreciate your help! Issue#1650  PR#1673 ~~Bugfix: Defer agent startup in Rails until after application-defined initializers have run ~~ ~~In Rails, the agent previously loaded before any application-defined initializers. This allowed initializers to reference the add_method_tracer API. However, this had the side-effect of forcing some framework libraries to load before initializers ran, preventing any configuration values related to these libraries from being applied. This fix provides an option to split initialization into two parts: load add_method_tracer before application-defined initializers and start the agent after application-defined initializers. This may cause other initializers to behave differently.~~ ~~If you'd like to use this feature, set defer_rails_initialization to true. It is false by default, but may become true by default in a future release.~~ ~~Furthermore, our Action View instrumentation was missing an ActiveSupport.on_load block around the code that loads our instrumentation.~~ ~~Thank you @jdelStrother  for bringing this to our attention and collaborating with us on a fix.

    "description": "v8.10.0 New gRPC instrumentation The agent will now instrument gRPC  activity performed by clients and servers that use the grpc  RubyGem. Instrumentation is automatic and enabled by default, so gRPC users should not need to modify any existing application code or agent configuration to benefit from the instrumentation. The instrumentation makes use of distributed tracing for a comprehensive overview of all gRPC traffic taking place across multiple monitored applications. This allows you to observe your client and server activity using any service that adheres to the W3C standard. The following new configuration parameters have been added for gRPC. All are optional. | Configuration name                   | Default | Behavior                                                                                |\n| ------------------------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| instrumentation.grpc_client        | auto    | Set to 'disabled' to disable, set to 'chain' if there are module prepending conflicts   |\n| instrumentation.grpc_server        | auto    | Set to 'disabled' to disable, set to 'chain' if there are module prepending conflicts   |\n| instrumentation.grpc.host_denylist | \"\"      | Provide a comma delimited list of host regex patterns (ex: \"private.com$,exception.*\") | Code-level metrics functionality is enabled by default The code-level metrics functionality for the Ruby agent's CodeStream integration  is now enabled by default after we have received positive feedback and no open bugs for the past two releases. Performance: Rework timing range overlap calculations for multiple transaction segments Many thanks to GitHub community members @bmulholland and @hkdnet. @bmulholland alerted us to rmosolgo/graphql-ruby#3945 . That Issue essentially notes that the New Relic Ruby agent incurs a significant perfomance hit when the graphql RubyGem (which ships with New Relic Ruby agent support) is used with DataLoader to generate a high number of transactions. Then @hkdnet diagnosed the root cause in the Ruby agent and put together both a proof of concept fix and a full blown PR to resolve the problem. The agent keeps track multiple segments that are concurrently in play for a given transaction in order to merge the ones whose start and stop times intersect. The logic for doing this find-and-merge operation has been reworked to a) be deferred entirely until the transaction is ready to be recorded, and b) made more performant when it is needed. GraphQL DataLoader users and other users who generate lots of activity for monitoring within a short amount of time will hopefully see some good performance gains from these changes. Performance: Make frozen string literals the default for the agent The Ruby frozen_string_literal: true magic source code comment has now been applied consistently across all Ruby files belonging to the agent. This can provide a performance boost, given that Ruby can rely on the strings remaining immutable. Previously only about a third of the agent's code was freezing string literals by default. Now that 100% of the code freezes string literals by default, we have internally observed some related performance gains through testing. We are hopeful that these will translate into some real world gains in production capacities. Bugfix: Error when setting the yaml configuration with transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold: apdex_f Originally, the agent was only checking the transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold from the newrelic.yml correctly if it was on two lines. Example: When this was instead changed to be on one line, the agent was not able to correctly identify the value of apdex_f. Example: This would cause prevent transactions from finishing due to the error ArgumentError: comparison of Float with String failed. This has now been corrected and the agent is able to process newrelic.yml with a one line transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold: apdex_f correctly now. Thank you to @oboxodo for bringing this to our attention. Bugfix: Don't modify frozen Logger Previously the agent would modify each instance of the Logger class by adding a unique instance variable as part of the instrumentation. This could cause the error FrozenError: can't modify frozen Logger to be thrown if the Logger instance had been frozen. The agent will now check if the object is frozen before attempting to modify the object. Thanks to @mkcosta for bringing this issue to our attention.

    "description": "v8.0.0 add_method_tracer refactored to use prepend over alias_method chaining This release overhauls the implementation of add_method_tracer, as detailed in issue #502 . The main breaking updates are as follows: A metric name passed to add_method_tracer will no longer be interpolated in an instance context as before. To maintain this behavior, pass a Proc object with the same arity as the method being traced. For example: Similarly, the :code_header and :code_footer options to add_method_tracer will only  accept a Proc object, which will be bound to the calling instance when the traced method is invoked. Calling add_method_tracer for a method will overwrite any previously defined tracers for that method. To specify multiple metric names for a single method tracer, pass them to add_method_tracer as an array. See updated documentation on the following pages for full details: Ruby Custom Instrumentation: Method Tracers MethodTracer::ClassMethods#add_method_tracer Distributed tracing is enabled by default Distributed tracing  tracks and observes service requests as they flow through distributed systems. Distributed tracing is now enabled by default and replaces cross application tracing . Bugfix: Incorrectly loading configuration options from newrelic.yml The agent will now  import the configuration options error_collector.ignore_messages  and error_collector.expected_messages  from the newrelic.yml file correctly. Cross Application is now deprecated, and disabled by default Distributed tracing  is replacing cross application tracing  as the default means of tracing between services. To continue using it, enable it with cross_application_tracer.enabled: true and distributed_tracing.enabled: false Update configuration option default value for span_events.max_samples_stored from 1000 to 2000 For more information about this congfiguration option, visit the Ruby agent documentation . Agent now enforces server supplied maximum value for configuration option span_events.max_samples_stored Upon connection to the New Relic servers, the agent will now enforce a maximum value allowed for the configuration option span_events.max_samples_stored  sent from the New Relic servers. Remove Ruby 2.0 required kwarg compatibility checks Our agent has code that provides compatibility for required keyword arguments in Ruby versions below 2.1. Since the agent now only supports Ruby 2.2+, this code is no longer required. Replace Time.now with Process.clock_gettime Calls to Time.now have been replaced with calls to Process.clock_gettime to leverage the system's built-in clocks for elapsed time (Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC) and wall-clock time (Process::CLOCK_REALTIME). This results in fewer object allocations, more accurate elapsed time records, and enhanced performance. Thanks to @sdemjanenko and @viraptor for advocating for this change! Updated generated default newrelic.yml Thank you @wyhaines and @creaturenex for your contribution. The default newrelic.yml that the agent can generate is now updated with commented out examples of all configuration options. Bugfix: Psych 4.0 causes errors when loading newrelic.yml Psych 4.0 now uses safe load behavior when using YAML.load which by default doesn't allow aliases, causing errors when the agent loads the config file. We have updated how we load the config file to avoid these errors. Remove support for Excon versions below 0.19.0 Excon versions below 0.19.0 will no longer be instrumented through the Ruby agent. Remove support for Mongo versions below 2.1 Mongo versions below 2.1 will no longer be instrumented through the Ruby agent. Remove tests for Rails 3.0 and Rails 3.1 As of the 7.0 release, the Ruby agent stopped supporting Rails 3.0 and Rails 3.1. Despite this, we still had tests for these versions running on the agent's CI. Those tests are now removed. Update test Gemfiles for patched versions The gem has individual Gemfiles it uses to test against different common user setups. Rails 5.2, 6.0, and 6.1 have been updated to the latest patch versions in the test Gemfiles. Rack was updated in the Rails61 test suite to 2.1.4 to resolve a security vulnerability. Remove Merb Support This release removes the remaining support for the Merb  framework. It merged with Rails during the 3.0 release. Now that the Ruby agent supports Rails 3.2 and above, we thought it was time to say goodbye. Remove deprecated method External.start_segment The method NewRelic::Agent::External.start_segment has been deprecated as of Ruby Agent 6.0.0. This method is now removed.

This allows users to inject the Browser agent themselves and use the nonce required for the script to run. In order to utilize this new feature, you must disable auto instrumentation for the Browser agent, and use the API method browser_timing_header to pass the nonce in and inject the script manually. Removed MD5 use in the SQL sampler In order to allow the agent to run in FIPS compliant environments, the usage of MD5 for aggregating slow sql traces has been replaced with SHA1.

Bugfix: Fix for missing part of a previous bugfix Our previous fix of \"nil Middlewares injection now prevented and gracefully handled in Sinatra\" released in 7.0.0 was partially overwritten by some of the other changes in that release. This release adds back those missing sections of the bugfix, and should resolve the issue for Sinatra users. Update known conflicts with use of Module#Prepend With our release of v7.0.0, we updated our instrumentation to use Module#Prepend by default, instead of method chaining. We have received reports of conflicts and added a check for these known conflicts. If a known conflict with prepend is detected while using the default value of 'auto' for gem instrumentation, the agent will instead install method chaining instrumentation in order to avoid this conflict.

Bugfix: Updated support for ActiveRecord 6.1+ instrumentation Previously, the agent depended on connection_id to be present in the Active Support instrumentation for sql.active_record\nto get the current ActiveRecord connection. As of Rails 6.1, connection_id has been dropped in favor of providing the connection\nobject through the connection value exclusively. This resulted in datastore spans displaying fallback behavior, including showing\n\"ActiveRecord\" as the database vendor. Bugfix: Updated support for Resque's FORK_PER_JOB option Support for Resque's FORK_PER_JOB flag within the Ruby agent was incomplete and nonfunctional.

We cover new configuration settings, diagnosiing and installing SSL CA certificates and deprecated items and their replacements in this guide. Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 dropped Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 dropped with this release.  We do not know of code changes that would prevent the agent from continuing to\nwork with these releases.  However, Rubies 2.0 and 2.1 are no longer included in our test matrices and are not supported for 7.0.0 and onward. Implemented prepend auto-instrumentation strategies for most Ruby gems/libraries This release brings the auto-instrumentation strategies for most gems into the modern era for Ruby by providing both\nprepend and method-chaining (also known as method-aliasing) strategies for auto instrumenting.  Prepend, which has been available since\nRuby 2.0, is now the default strategy employed in auto-instrumenting. It's a known issue that some external gems lead to Stack Level too Deep exceptions when prepend and method-chaining are mixed. In such known cases, the auto-instrumenting strategy will fall back to method-chaining automatically. This release also deprecates many overlapping and inconsistently named configuration settings in favor of being able to control\nbehavior of instrumentation per library with one setting that can be one of auto (the default), disabled, prepend, or chain. Please see the above-referenced migration guide for further details. Removed SSL cert bundle The agent will no longer ship this bundle and will rely on system certs. Removed deprecated config options The following config options were previously deprecated and are no longer available: disable_active_record_4 disable_active_record_5 autostart.blacklisted_constants autostart.blacklisted_executables autostart.blacklisted_rake_tasks strip_exception_messages.whitelist Removed deprecated attribute The attribute httpResponseCode was previously deprecated and replaced with http.statusCode. This deprecated attribute has now been removed. Removed deprecated option in notice_error Previously, the :trace_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice_error was deprecated and replaced with :expected. This deprecated option has been removed. Removed deprecated API methods Previously the API methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload were deprecated. These have now been removed. Instead, please see insert_distributed_trace_headers and accept_distributed_trace_headers, respectively. Bugfix: Prevent browser monitoring middleware from installing to middleware multiple times In rare cases on jRuby, the BrowserMonitoring middleware could attempt to install itself\nmultiple times at start up.  This bug fix addresses that by using a mutex to introduce\nthread safety to the operation.  Sinatra in particular can have this race condition because\nits middleware stack is not installed until the first request is received. Skip constructing Time for transactions Thanks to @viraptor, we are no longer constructing an unused Time object with every call to starting a new Transaction. Bugfix: nil Middlewares injection now prevented and gracefully handled in Sinatra Previously, the agent could potentially inject multiples of an instrumented middleware if Sinatra received many\nrequests at once during start up and initialization due to Sinatra's ability to delay full startup as long as possible.\nThis has now been fixed, and the Ruby agent correctly instruments only once as well as gracefully handles nil middleware\nclasses in general. Bugfix: Ensure transaction nesting max depth is always consistent with length of segments Thanks to @warp for noticing and fixing the scenario where Transaction nesting_max_depth can get out of sync\nwith segment length resulting in an exception when attempting to nest the initial segment which does not exist.

    "description": "New Relic Ruby Agent Release Notes Added support for W3C Trace Context, with easy upgrade from New Relic trace context Distributed tracing now supports W3C Trace Context headers  for HTTP protocols when distributed tracing is enabled. Our implementation can accept and emit both the W3C trace header format and the New Relic trace header format. This simplifies agent upgrades, allowing trace context to be propagated between services with older and newer releases of New Relic agents. W3C trace header format will always be accepted and emitted. New Relic trace header format will be accepted, and you can optionally disable emission of the New Relic trace header format. When distributed tracing is enabled by setting distributed_tracing.enabled to true, the Ruby agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling DistributedTracing.accept_distributed_trace_headers or automatically via http instrumentation. When calling DistributedTracing.insert_distributed_trace_headers, or automatically via http instrumentation, the Ruby agent will include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header, unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled by setting exclude_newrelic_header setting to true. Added DistributedTracing.accept_distributed_trace_headers API for accepting both New Relic and W3C TraceContext distributed traces. Deprecated DistributedTracing.accept_distributed_trace_payload which will be removed in a future major release. Added DistributedTracing.insert_distributed_trace_headers API for adding outbound distributed trace headers. Both W3C TraceContext and New Relic formats will be included unless distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true. Deprecated DistributedTracing.create_distributed_trace_payload which will be removed in a future major release. Known issues and workarounds: If a .NET agent is initiating distributed traces as the root service, you must update that .NET agent to version 8.24 or later before upgrading your downstream Ruby New Relic agents to this agent release. Official Ruby 2.7 support The Ruby agent has been verified to run with Ruby 2.7.0. Reduced allocations when tracing transactions using API calls Default empty hashes for options parameter were not frozen, leading to excessive and unnecessary allocations when calling APIs for tracing transactions. Thanks to Joel Turkel (jturkel) for the contribution! Bugfix for Resque worker thread race conditions Recent changes in Rack surfaced issues marshalling data for Resque, surfaced a potential race-condition with closing out the worker-threads before flushing the data pipe. This is now fixed. Thanks to Bertrand Paquet (bpaquet) for the contribution! Bugfix for Content-Length when injecting browser monitoring JS The Content-Length HTTP header would be incorrect after injecting the browser monitoring JS into the HEAD tag of the HTML source with Content-Length and lead to the HTML BODY content being truncated in some cases. The Content-Length is now correctly updated after injecting the browser monitoring JS script. Thanks to Slava Kardakov (ojab) for the contribution!",

    "description": "v6.8.0 Initial Ruby 2.7 support The Ruby agent has been verified to run with Ruby 2.7.0-preview1. New API method to add custom attributes to Spans New API method for adding custom attributes to spans . Previously, custom attributes were only available at the Transaction level. Now, with Span level custom attributes, more granular tagging is possible for easier isolation and review of traces. For more information: Agent#add_custom_span_attributes Enables ability to migrate to configurable security policies (CSP) on a per-agent basis for accounts already using high-security mode (HSM). When both HSM  and CSP  are enabled for an account, an agent (this version or later) can successfully connect with either high_security: true or the appropriate security_policies_token configured. high_security has been added as part of the preconnect payload. Bugfix for logs-in-context combined with act-fluent-logger-rails Previously, when using the Ruby agent's logs-in-context logger to link logging data with trace and entity metadata for an improved experience in the UI, customers who were also using the act-fluent-logger-rails gem would see a NoMethodError for clear_tags! that would interfere with the use of this feature. This error no longer appears, allowing customers to combine the use of logs-in-context with the use of this gem. Please note that the logs-in-context logger does not support tagged logging; if you are initializing your logger with a log_tags argument, your custom tags may not appear on the final version of your logs. Bugfix for parsing invalid newrelic.yml Previously, if the newrelic.yml configuration file was invalid, and the agent could not start as a result, the agent would not log any indication of the problem. This version of the agent will emit a FATAL message to STDOUT when this scenario occurs so that customers can address issues with newrelic.yml that prevent startup. Configuration options containing the terms \"whitelist\" and \"blacklist\" deprecated The following local configuration settings have been deprecated: autostart.blacklisted_constants: use autostart.denylisted_constants instead. autostart.blacklisted_executables: use autostart.denylisted_executables instead. autostart.blacklisted_rake_tasks: use autostart.denylisted_rake_tasks instead. strip_exception_messages.whitelist: use strip_exception_messages.allowed_classes instead. Bugfix for module loading and constant resolution in Rails Starting in version 6.3, the Ruby agent has caused module loading and constant resolution to sometimes fail, which caused errors in some Rails applications. These errors were generally NoMethodError exceptions or I18n errors translation missing or invalid locale. These errors would not appear if the agent was removed from the application's Gemfile. This version of the agent fixes these issues with module loading and constant resolution, so these errors no longer occur. Bugfix: failed to get urandom Previous versions of the agent would fail unexpectedly when the Ruby process used every available file descriptor. The failures would include this message: This version of the agent uses a different strategy for generating random IDs, and will not fail in the same way when no file descriptors are available.",

    "description": "v6.7.0 Support for Real Time Streaming Event data is now sent to New Relic every five seconds, instead of every minute. As a result, transaction, error, and custom events will now be available in New Relic and Insights dashboards in near real time. For more information on how to view your events with a five-second refresh, see the real time streaming documentation . Note that the overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute have not changed. Also, span events, metrics, and trace data is unaffected, and will still be sent every minute. Trace and Entity Metadata API Several new API methods have been added to the agent: Agent#linking_metadata Tracer#trace_id Tracer#span_id Tracer#sampled? These API methods allow you to access information that can be used to link data of your choosing to a trace or entity. Logs in Context This version of the agent includes a logger, which can be used in place of ::Logger from the standard library, or ActiveSupport::Logger from Rails. This logger leverages the new trace and entity metadata API to decorate log statements with entity and trace metadata, so they can be correlated together in the New Relic UI. For more information on how to use logs in context, see https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/enable-logs-context-ruby Project metadata in Gemspec Project metadata has been added to the gemspec file.

    "description": "Improvements Change to default setting for ActiveRecord connection resolution Due to incompatibilities between the faster ActiveRecord connection resolution released in Ruby agent v6.3.0 and other gems that patch ActiveRecord, backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup will now be set to false by default. This will result in significant performance improvement. Recommendation:  If your environment includes ActiveRecord, change this setting to true. Exception:  If you are using other gems that measure ActiveRecord performance, they may lose functionality when combined with this setting. If you are unsure whether to enable backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup, we recommend enabling it in a development environment to make sure other gems that patch ActiveRecord are still working as expected. Fixes Bugfix for ActiveStorage instrumentation error Version 6.4.0 of the agent introduced a bug that interfered with ActiveStorage callbacks, resulting in the agent being unable to instrument ActiveStorage operations. ActiveStorage segments are now correctly recorded. Bugfix for ActiveRecord 4.1 and 4.2 exception logging Version 6.3.0 of the agent introduced a bug that prevented ActiveRecord versions 4.1 and 4.2 from logging exceptions that occurred within a database transaction. This version of the agent restores the exception logging functionality from previous agent versions. Thanks to Oleksiy Kovyrin for the contribution!

These may be added to transaction events to provide context between your Kubernetes cluster and your services. For details on the behavior, see this blog post . Bugfix for faster ActiveRecord connection resolution Version 6.3.0 of the agent backported the faster ActiveRecord connection resolution from Rails 6.0 to previous versions, but the implementation caused certain other gems which measured ActiveRecord performance to stop working. This version of the agent changes the implementation of this performance improvement so no such conflicts occur. Bugfix for Grape instrumentation error Previous versions of the agent would fail to install Grape instrumentation in Grape versions 1.2.0 and up if the API being instrumented subclassed Grape::API::Instance rather than Grape::API. A warning would also print to the newrelic_agent log: This version of the agent successfully installs instrumentation for subclasses of Grape::API::Instance, and these log messages should no longer appear. Bugfix for streaming responses Previous versions of the agent would attempt to insert JavaScript instrumentation into any streaming response that did not make use of ActionController::Live. This resulted in an empty, non-streamed response being sent to the client. This version of the agent will not attempt to insert JavaScript instrumentation into a response which includes the header Transfer-Encoding=chunked, which indicates a streaming response.

This new setting will affect the instrumentation of ActiveRecord 4, 5, and 6. The deprecated settings will be removed in a future release. Bugfix for newrelic deployments script For applications housed in the EU, the newrelic deployments script included with previous versions of the agent would fail with the following message: Deployment not recorded: Application does not exist. This is because the script would attempt to send the deployment notification to the US region. The deployment script now sends deployments to the correct region. Faster ActiveRecord connection resolution This version of the agent uses the faster ActiveRecord connection resolution that Rails 6.0 uses, even on previous versions of Rails.

Special thanks to @hasghari for setting this up! Added support for Sidekiq 6.0, 6.1 The Ruby agent has been verified to run with both 6.0 and 6.1 versions of sidekiq. Bugfix: No longer overwrites sidekiq trace data Distributed tracing data is now added to the job trace info rather than overwriting the existing data. Bugfix: Fixes cases where errors are reported for spans with no other attributes Previously, in cases where a span does not have any agent/custom attributes on it, but an error is noticed and recorded against the span, a FrozenError: can't modify frozen Hash is thrown. This is now fixed, and errors are now correctly recorded against such span events. Bugfix: DistributedTracing.insert_distributed_trace_headers Supportability metric now recorded Previously, API calls to DistributedTracing.insert_distributed_trace_headers would lead to an exception about the missing supportability metric rather than flowing through the API implementation as intended. This would potentially lead to broken distributed traces, as the trace headers were not inserted on the API call. DistributedTracing.insert_distributed_trace_headers now correctly records the supportability metric and inserts the distributed trace headers as intended. Bugfix: child completions after parent completes sometimes throws exception attempting to access nil parent In scenarios where the child segment/span is completing after the parent in jRuby, the parent may have already been freed and no longer accessible. This would lead to attempting to calll descendant_complete on a nil object. This is fixed to protect against calling the descendant_complete in these cases. Feature: implements force_install_exit_handler config flag The force_install_exit_handler configuration flag allows an application to instruct the agent to install its graceful shutdown exit handler. This sends any locally cached data to the New Relic collector before the application shuts down. This is useful when the primary framework has an embedded Sinatra application that is otherwise detected and skips installing the exit hook for graceful shutdowns. Default prepend_net_instrumentation to false Previously, prepend_net_instrumentation defaulted to true. However, many gems are still using monkey patching on Net::HTTP, which causes compatibility issues with using prepend. Defaulting this to false minimizes instances of unexpected compatibility issues. Infinite tracing adds additional data to connection metadata Adds data from the agents connect response request_headers_map to the metadata for the connection to the infinite trace observer.

This has been fixed. Bugfix: Delayed Job instrumentation fixed for Ruby 2.7+ Previously, the agent was erroneousy separating positional and keyword arguments on the instrumented method calls into Delayed Job's library. The led to Delayed job not auto-instrumenting correctly and has been fixed. Bugfix: Ruby 2.7+ methods sometimes erroneously attributed compiler warnings to the Agent's add_method_tracer The specific edge cases presented are now fixed by this release of the agent. There are still some known corner-cases that will be resolved with upcoming changes in next major release of the Agent. If you encounter a problem with adding method tracers and compiler warnings raised, please continue to submit small repoducible examples. Bugfix: Ruby 2.7+ fix for keyword arguments on Rack apps is unnecessary and removed A common fix for positional and keyword arguments for method parameters was implemented where it was not needed and led to RackApps getting extra arguments converted to keyword arguments rather than Hash when it expected one. This Ruby 2.7+ change was reverted so that Rack apps behave correctly for Ruby >= 2.7. Feature: captures incoming and outgoing request headers for distributed tracing HTTP request headers will be logged when log level is at least debug level. Similarly, request headers for exchanges with New Relic servers are now audit logged when audit logging is enabled. Bugfix: newrelic.yml.erb added to the configuration search path Previously, when a user specifies a newrelic.yml.erb and no newrelic.yml file, the agent fails to find the .erb file because it was not in the list of files searched at startup. The Ruby agent has long supported this as a means of configuring the agent programatically. The newrelic.yml.erb filename is restored to the search path and will be utilized if present. NOTE: newrelic.yml still takes precedence over newrelic.yml.erb If found, the .yml file is used instead of the .erb file. Search directories and order of traversal remain unchanged. Bugfix: dependency detection of Redis now works without raising an exception Previously, when detecting if Redis was available to instrument, the dependency detection would fail with an Exception raised (with side effect of not attempting to instrument Redis). This is now fixed with a better dependency check that resolves falsly without raising an Exception. Bugfix: Gracefully handles NilClass as a Middleware Class when instrumenting Previously, if a NilClass is passed as the Middleware Class to instrument when processing the middleware stack, the agent would fail to fully load and instrument the middleware stack. This fix gracefully skips over nil classes. Memory Sampler updated to recognize macOS Big Sur Previously, the agent was unable to recognize the platform macOS Big Sur in the memory sampler, resulting in an error being logged. The memory sampler is now able to recognize Big Sur. Prepend implementation of Net::HTTP instrumentation available There is now a config option (prepend_net_instrumentation) that will enable the agent to use prepend while instrumenting Net::HTTP.

    "description": "v6.13.0 Bugfix: never use redirect host when accessing preconnect endpoint When connecting to New Relic, the Ruby Agent uses the value in Agent.config[:host] to post a request to the New Relic preconnect endpoint. This endpoint returns a \"redirect host\" which is the URL to which agents send data from that point on. Previously, if the agent needed to reconnect to the collector, it would incorrectly use this redirect host to call the preconnect endpoint, when it should have used the original configured value in Agent.config[:host]. The agent now uses the correct host for all calls to preconnect. Bugfix: calling add_custom_attributes no longer modifies the params of the caller The previous agent's improvements to recording attributes at the span level had an unexpected side-effect of modifying the params passed to the API call as duplicated attributes were deleted in the process. This is now fixed and params passed in are no longer modified. Thanks to Pete Johns (@johnsyweb) for the PR that resolves this bug. Bugfix: http.url query parameters spans are now obfuscated Previously, the agent was recording the full URL of the external requests, including the query and fragment parts of the URL as part of the attributes on the external request span. This has been fixed so that the URL is obfuscated to filter out potentially sensitive data. Use system SSL certificates by default The Ruby agent previously used a root SSL/TLS certificate bundle by default. Now the agent will attempt to use the default system certificates, but will fall back to the bundled certs if there is an issue (and log that this occurred). Bugfix: reduce allocations for segment attributes Previously, every segment received an Attributes object on initialization. The agent now lazily creates attributes on segments, resulting in a significant reduction in object allocations for a typical transaction. Bugfix: eliminate errors around Rake::VERSION with Rails When running a Rails application with rake tasks, customers could see the following error: Prevent connecting agent thread from hanging on shutdown A bug in Net::HTTP's Gzip decoder can cause the (un-catchable) thread-kill exception to be replaced with a (catchable) Zlib exception, which prevents a connecting agent thread from exiting during shutdown, causing the Ruby process to hang indefinitely. This workaround checks for an aborting thread in the #connect exception handler and re-raises the exception, allowing a killed thread to continue exiting. Thanks to Will Jordan (@wjordan) for chasing this one down and patching with tests. Fix error messages about Rake instrumentation When running a Rails application with rake tasks, customers could see the following error in logs resulting from a small part of rake functionality being loaded with the Rails test runner: Such error messages should no longer appear in this context.

    "description": "New Relic Ruby Agent Release Notes v6.12.0 The New Relic Ruby agent is now open source under the Apache 2 license  and you can now observe the project roadmap. See our Contributing guide  and Code of Conduct  for details on contributing! Security: Updated all uses of Rake to >= 12.3.3 All versions of Rake testing prior to 12.3.3 were removed to address CVE-2020-8130 . No functionality in the agent was removed nor deprecated with this change, and older versions of rake are expected to continue to work as they have in the past. However, versions of rake < 12.3.3 are no longer tested nor supported. Bugfix: fixes an error capturing content length in middleware on multi-part responses In the middleware tracing, the Content-Length header is sometimes returned as an array of values when content is a multi-part response. Previously, the agent would fail with \"NoMethodError: undefined method to_i for Array\" Error. This bug is now fixed and multi-part content lengths are summed for a total when an Array is present. Added support for auto-instrumenting Mongo gem versions 2.6 to 2.12 Bugfix: MongoDB instrumentation did not handle CommandFailed events when noticing errors The mongo gem sometimes returns a CommandFailed object instead of a CommandSucceeded object with error attributes populated. The instrumentation did not handle noticing errors on CommandFailed objects and resulted in logging an error and backtrace to the log file. Additionally, a bug in recording the metric for \"findAndModify\" as all lowercased \"findandmodify\" for versions 2.1 through 2.5 was fixed. Bugfix: Priority Sampler causes crash in high throughput environments in rare cases Previously, the priority sampling buffer would, in rare cases, generate an error in high-throughput environments once capacity is reached and the sampling algorithm engages. This issue is fixed. Additional transaction information applied to Spans When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, the agent will now incorporate additional information from the Transaction event on to the root Span of the transaction.

    "description": "New Relic Ruby Agent Release Notes v6.11.0 Infinite Tracing This release adds support for Infinite Tracing . Infinite Tracing observes 100% of your distributed traces and provides visualizations for the most actionable data. With Infinite Tracing, you get examples of errors and long-running traces so you can better diagnose and troubleshoot your systems. Configure your agent to send traces to a trace observer in New Relic Edge. View distributed traces through New Relic’s UI. There is no need to install a collector on your network. Infinite Tracing is currently available on a sign-up basis. If you would like to participate, please contact your sales representative. Bugfix: Cross Application Tracing (CAT) adds a missing field to response Previously, the CAT header was missing a reserved field that would lead to an error in the Go Agent's processing of incoming headers from the Ruby Agent. This fix adds that missing field to the headers. Bugfix: Environment Report now supports Rails >= 6.1 The API changed for how database connections are accessed in Rails versions starting with 6.1 to support multiple database feature. The Environment report was enhanced to use the Rails >= 6.1 API with fallback to old API when that fails. Thanks to Sébastien Dubois (sedubois) for reporting this issue and contribution! Bugfix: Eliminate warnings appearing when using add_method_tracer with Ruby 2.7 Previously, using add_method_tracer with Ruby 2.7 to trace a method that included keyword arguments resulted in warning messages: warning: Using the last argument as keyword parameters is deprecated; maybe ** should be added to the call. These messages no longer appear. Thanks to Harm de Wit and Atsuo Fukaya for reporting the issue! Added distributed tracing to Sidekiq jobs Thanks to andreaseger for the contribution!",

    "description": "New Relic Ruby Agent Release Notes Error attributes now added to each span that exits with an error or exception Error attributes error.class and error.message are now included on the span event in which an error or exception was noticed, and, in the case of unhandled exceptions, on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error. The public API method notice_error now attaches these error attributes to the currently executing span. Spans with error details are now highlighted red in the Distributed Tracing UI , and error details will expose the associated error.class and error.message. It is also now possible to see when an exception leaves the boundary of the span, and if it is caught in an ancestor span without reaching the entry span. NOTE: This “bubbling up” of exceptions will impact the error count when compared to prior behavior for the same trace. It is possible to have a trace that now has span errors without the trace level showing an error. If multiple errors occur on the same span, only the most recent error information is added to the attributes. Prior errors on the same span are overwritten. These span event attributes conform to ignored errors  and expected errors . Added tests for latest Grape / Rack combination For a short period of time, the latest versions of Grape and Rack had compatibility issues. Generally, Rack 2.1.0 should be avoided in all cases due to breaking changes in many gems reliant on Rack. We recommend using either Rack <= 2.0.9, or using latest Rack when using Grape (2.2.2 at the time of this writing). Bugfix: Calculate Content-Length in bytes Previously, the Content-Length HTTP header would be incorrect after injecting the Browser Monitoring JS when the response contained Unicode characters because the value was not calculated in bytes. The Content-Length is now correctly updated. Thanks to thaim for the contribution! Bugfix: Fix Content-Length calculation when response is nil Previously, calculating the Content-Length HTTP header would result in a NoMethodError in the case of a nil response. These errors will no longer occur in such a case. Thanks to Johan Van Ryseghem for the contribution! Bugfix: DecoratingFormatter now logs timestamps as millisecond Integers Previously the agent sent timestamps as a Float with milliseconds as part of the fractional value. Logs in Context was changed to only accept Integer values and this release changes DecoratingFormatter to match. Added --force option to newrelic install cli command to allow overwriting newrelic.yml Bugfix: The fully qualified hostname now works correctly for BSD and Solaris Previously, when running on systems such as BSD and Solaris, the agent was unable to determine the fully qualified domain name, which is used to help link Ruby agent data with data from New Relic Infrastructure. This information is now successfully collected on various BSD distros and Solaris.",

    "description": "v6.0.0 Tracer API for flexible custom instrumentation With agent version 6.0, we are introducing the Tracer class, an officially supported public API for more flexible custom instrumentation. By calling its in_transaction method, you can instrument an arbitrary section of Ruby code without needing to juggle any explicit state. Behind the scenes, the agent will make sure that the measured code results in an APM segment inside a transaction. The same API contains additional methods for creating transactions and segments, and for interacting with the current transaction. For more details, see the custom instrumentation documentation . If you were previously using any of the agent's private, undocumented APIs, such as Transaction.wrap or Transaction.start/stop, you will need to update your code to use the Tracer API. The full list of APIs that were removed or deprecated are: External.start_segment Transaction.create_segment Transaction.start Transaction.stop Transaction.start_datastore_segment Transaction.start_segment Transaction.wrap TransactionState.current_transaction If are you using any of these APIs, please see the upgrade guide  for a list of replacements.

The agent now correctly calculates capacity for transactions with ActionController::Live. Add ability to exclude attributes from span events and transaction segments Agent versions 5.5 and lower could selectively exclude attributes from page views, error traces, transaction traces, and transaction events. With agent version 5.6 and higher, you can also exclude attributes from span events (via the span_events.include/exclude options) and from transaction segments (via the transaction_segments.include/exclude options). As with other attribute destinations, these new options will inherit values from the top-level attributes.include/exclude settings. See the documentation  for more information. Increasing backoff sequence on failing to connect to New Relic If the agent cannot reach New Relic, it will now wait for an increasing amount of time after each failed attempt. We are also starting with a shorter delay initially, which will help customer apps bounce back more quickly from transient network errors. Truncation of long stack traces Previous versions of the agent would truncate long stack traces to 50 frames.

An agent class method NewRelic::Agent.require_test_helper was used by 3rd party gem authors to test extensions to the agent. The required file is now included in the gem. Collect cloud metadata from Azure, GCP, PCF, and AWS cloud platform The agent now collects additional metadata when running in AWS, GCP, Azure, and PCF. This information is used to provide an enhanced experience when the agent is deployed on those platforms. Install at_exit hook when running JRuby The agent now installs an at_exit hook when running JRuby, which wasn't done before because of constraints related to older JRuby versions that are no longer supported. User/Utilization and System/Utilization metrics not recorded after Resque forks The agent no longer records invalid User/Utilization and System/Utilization metrics, which can lead to negative values, in forks of Resque processes. Add identifier field to agent connect settings The agent now includes a unique identifier in its connect settings, ensuring that when multiple agents connect to multiple different apps, data are reported for each of the apps. Clear transaction state after forking now opt-in The agent waits to connect until the first web request when it detects it's running in a forking dispatcher. When clearing the transaction state in this situation we lose the first frame of the transaction and the subsequent trace becomes corrupted. We've made this feature opt-in and is turned off by default. This behavior only affects the first transaction after a dispatcher forks.",

Safely normalize external hostnames The agent has been updated to check for nil host values before downcasing the hostname. Thanks Rafael Valério for the contribution! PageView events will not be generated for ignored transactions The agent now checks if transaction is ignored before injecting the New Relic Browser Agent. This will prevent PageView events from being generated for ignored transactions. Datastores required explicitly in agent The agent has been modified to explicity require the Datastores module whereas previously there were situations where the module could be implicitly defined. Thanks Kevin Griffin for the contribution! Clear transaction state after forking Previously, if a transaction was started and the process forks, the transaction state survived the fork and #after_fork call in thread local storage. Now, this state is cleared by #after_fork. Postgis adapter reports as Postgres for datastores The agent now maps the Postgis adapter to Postgres for datastore metrics.

We've been testing things out since the early previews so you can upgrade to the latest and greatest and use New Relic right away to see how the new Ruby's performing for you. Support for Rails 4.2 and ActiveJob Not only is a new Ruby available, but a new Rails is out too! The Ruby agent provides all the usual support for Rails that you'd expect, and we instrument the newly released ActiveJob framework that's part of 4.2. Security fix for handling of error responses from New Relic servers This release fixes a potential security issue wherein an attacker who was able to impersonate New Relic's servers could have triggered arbitrary code execution in agent's host processes by sending a specially-crafted error response to a data submission request. This issue is mitigated by the fact that the agent uses SSL certificate checking in order to verify the identity of the New Relic servers to which it connects. SSL is enabled by default by the agent. It can be enforced account-wide by enabling High-security mode  for your account. Fix for transactions with invalid URIs If an application used the agent's ignore_url_regexes config setting to ignore certain transactions, but received an invalid URI, the agent would fail to record the transaction. This has been fixed. Fixed incompatibility with newrelic-grape The 3.9.8 release of the Ruby agent included disabled prototyped instrumentation for the Grape API framework.

Reduced memory usage for idling applications Idling applications using the agent could previously appear to leak memory because of native allocations during creation of new SSL connections to our servers. These native allocations didn't factor into triggering Ruby's garbage collector. The agent will now re-use a single TCP connection to our servers for as long as possible, resulting in improved memory usage for applications that are idling and not having GC triggered for other reasons. Don't write to stderr during CPU sampling The Ruby agent's code for gathering CPU information would write error messages to stderr on some FreeBSD systems. This has been fixed. LocalJumpError on Rails 2.x Under certain conditions, Rails 2.x controller instrumentation could fail with a LocalJumpError when an action was not being traced. This has been fixed.

    "description": "Notes Rails 4.2 ActiveJob support A new version of Rails is coming! One of the highlight features is ActiveJob, a framework for interacting with background job processors. This release of the Ruby agent adds instrumentation to give you insight into ActiveJob, whether you're just testing it out or running it for real. Metrics are recorded around enqueuing ActiveJobs, and background transactions are started for any ActiveJob performed where the agent didn't already provide specific instrumentation (such as DelayedJob, Resque and Sidekiq). Since Rails 4.2 is still in beta we'd love to hear any feedback on this instrumentation so it'll be rock solid for the general release! Ruby 2.2.0-preview1 updates Ruby 2.2.0 is on its way later in the year, and the Ruby agent is ready for it. Updates to the GC stats and various other small changes have already been applied, and our automated tests are running against 2.2.0 so the agent will be ready on release day. Ignoring transactions by URL While you could always ignore transactions by controller and action, the Ruby agent previously lacked a way to ignore by specific URLs or patterns without code changes. This release adds the config setting, rules.ignore_url_regexes to ignore specific transactions based on the request URL as well. For more information, see the documentation at: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation-configurat... Better dependency detection in non-Rack applications The Ruby agent runs dependency detection at key points in the Rack and Rails lifecycle, but non-Rails apps could occasionally miss out instrumenting late loaded libraries. The agent now runs an additional dependency detection during manual_start to more seamlessly install instrumentation in any app. Excluding /newrelic routes from developer mode Recent changes to track time in middleware resulted in New Relic's developer mode capturing its own page views in the list. This has been fixed. Thanks to Ignatius Reza Lesmana for the report! Spikes in external time Timeouts during certain external HTTP requests could result in incorrect large spikes in the time recorded by the agent. This has been fixed. Recognize browser_monitoring.auto_instrument setting in non-Rails apps The browser_monitoring.auto_instrument config setting disables auto-injection of JavaScript into your pages, but was not properly obeyed in Sinatra and other non-Rails contexts. This has been fixed. Failures to gather CPU thread time on JRuby JRuby running on certain JVM's and operating systems (FreeBSD in particular) did not always support the method being used to gather CPU burn metrics. This would result in a failure during those transactions. This has been fixed. Fix for rare race condition in Resque instrumentation A race condition in the agent's Resque instrumentation that could cause rare Resque job failures in high-throughput Resque setups has been fixed. This bug would manifest as an exception with the following error message: \"RuntimeError: can't add a new key into hash during iteration\" and a backtrace leading through the PipeChannelManager class in the agent.",

Notes Per-dyno data on Heroku When running on Heroku, data from the agent can now be broken out by dyno name, allowing you to more easily see what's happening on a per-dyno level. Dynos on Heroku are now treated in the same way that distinct hosts on other platforms work. By default, 'scheduler' and 'run' dyno names will be aggregated into scheduler.* and run.* to avoid unbounded growth in the number of reported hostnames. Read more about this feature on our Heroku docs page: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/miscellaneous/ruby-agen... HTTP response codes in Insights events The Ruby agent will now capture HTTP response codes from Rack applications (including Rails and Sinatra apps) and include them under the httpResponseCode attribute on events sent to Insights. Stricter limits on memory usage of metrics and SQL traces The agent now imposes stricter limits on the number of distinct SQL traces and metrics that it will buffer in memory at any point in time, leading to more predictable memory consumption even in exceptional circumstances. Improved reliability of thread profiling Several issues that would previously have prevented the successful completion and transmission of thread profiles to New Relic's servers have been fixed. These issues were related to the use of recursion in processing thread profiles, and have been addressed by both limiting the maximum depth of the backtraces recorded in thread profiles, and eliminating the agent's use of recursion in processing profile data. Allow tracing Rails view helpers with add_method_tracer Previously, attempting to trace a Rails view helper method using add_method_tracer on the view helper module would lead to a NoMethodError when the traced method was called (undefined method `trace_execution_scoped'). This has been fixed. This issue was an instance of the Ruby 'dynamic module inclusion' or 'double inclusion' problem. Usage of add_method_tracer now no longer relies upon the target class having actually picked up the trace_execution_scoped method from the NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer module. Improved performance of queue time parsing The number of objects allocated while parsing the frontend timestamps on incoming HTTP requests has been significantly reduced.

Notes Added API for ignoring transactions This release adds three new API calls for ignoring transactions: NewRelic::Agent.ignore_transaction NewRelic::Agent.ignore_apdex NewRelic::Agent.ignore_enduser ignore_transaction ignores a transaction completely: nothing about it will be reported to New Relic. ignore_apdex ignores only the Apdex metric for a single transaction. ignore_enduser disables Javascript injection for browser monitoring for the current transaction. These methods differ from the existing newrelic_ignore_* method in that they may be called during  a transaction based on some dynamic runtime criteria, as opposed to at the class level on startup. For more information, see ignoring specific transactions . Improved SQL obfuscation SQL queries containing string literals ending in backslash \\ characters were not correctly obfuscated by the Ruby agent prior to transmission to New Relic. In addition, SQL comments were left un-obfuscated. This has been fixed, and the test coverage for SQL obfuscation has been improved. newrelic_ignore* methods now work when called in a superclass The newrelic_ignore* family of methods previously did not apply to subclasses of the class from which it was called, meaning that Rails controllers inheriting from a single base class where newrelic_ignore had been called would not be ignored. This has been fixed. Fix for rare crashes in Rack::Request#params on Sinatra apps Certain kinds of malformed HTTP requests previously caused unhandled exceptions in the Ruby agent's Sinatra instrumentation, in the Rack::Request#params method. This has been fixed. Improved handling for rare errors caused by timeouts in Excon requests In some rare cases, the agent would emit a warning message in its log file and abort instrumentation of a transaction if a timeout occurred during an Excon request initiated from within that transaction. This has been fixed. Improved behavior when the agent is misconfigured When the agent is misconfigured by attempting to shut it down without it ever having been started, or by attempting to disable instrumentation after instrumentation has already been installed, the agent will no longer raise an exception, but will instead log an error to its log file. Fix for ignore_error_filter not working in some configurations The ignore_error_filter method allows you to specify a block to be evaluated in order to determine whether a given error should be ignored by the agent. If the agent was initially disabled, and then later enabled with a call to manual_start, the ignore_error_filter would not work. This has been fixed. Fix for Capistrano 3 ignoring newrelic_revision New Relic's Capistrano recipes support passing parameters to control the values recorded with deployments, but user-provided :newrelic_revision values were incorrectly overwritten. This has been fixed. Agent errors logged with ruby-prof in production If the ruby-prof gem was available in an environment without New Relic's developer mode enabled, the agent would generate errors to its log. This has been fixed. Tighter requirements on naming for configuration environment variables The agent would previously assume any environment variable containing NEWRELIC was a configuration setting.

Notes Ruby 1.8.7 users: upgrade or add JSON gem now Ruby 1.8.7 is end-of-lifed, and not receiving security updates, so we strongly encourage all users with apps on 1.8.7 to upgrade. If you're not able to upgrade yet, be aware that a coming release of the Ruby agent will require users of Ruby 1.8.7 to have the 'json' gem available within their applications in order to continue sending data to New Relic. Support for new Cross Application Trace view This release enhances cross application tracing with a visualization of the cross application calls that a specific Transaction Trace is involved in. The new visualization helps you spot bottlenecks in external services within Transaction Traces and gives you an end-to-end understanding of how the transaction trace is used by other applications and services. This leads to faster problem diagnosis and better collaboration across teams. All agents involved in the cross application communication must be upgraded to see the complete graph. You can view cross application traces from in the Transaction Trace drill-down. High-security mode v2 The Ruby agent now supports v2 of New Relic's high-security mode. To enable it, you must add 'high_security: true' to your newrelic.yml  file, and enable high-security mode through the New Relic web interface. The local agent setting must be in agreement with the server-side setting, or the agent will shut down and no data will be collected. Customers who already had the server-side high-security mode setting enabled must add 'high_security: true' to their agent configuration files when upgrading to this release. For details on high-security mode, see: http://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security/hi...

Previous versions of the agent would count all time spent in the block given to 'cas' as memcache time, but 1.8.0 or higher allows us to more accurately measure just the time spent talking to memcache. Many thanks to Francis Bogsanyi for contributing this change! Improved support for Rails apps launched from outside the app root directory The Ruby agent attempts to resolve the location of its configuration file at runtime relative to the directory that the host process is started from. In cases where the host process was started from outside of the application's root directory (for example, if the process is started from from '/'), it will now also attempt to locate its configuration file based on the value of Rails.root for Rails applications. Better compatibility with ActionController::Live Browser Application Monitoring auto-injection can cause request failures under certain circumstances when used with ActionController::Live, so the agent will now automatically detect usage of ActionController::Live, and not attempt auto-injection for those requests (even if auto-instrumentation is otherwise enabled). Many thanks to Rodrigo Rosenfeld Rosas for help diagnosing this issue! Fix for occasional spikes in external services time Certain kinds of failures during HTTP requests made by an application could have previously resulted in the Ruby agent reporting erroneously large amounts of time spent in outgoing HTTP requests. This issue manifested most obviously in spikes on the 'Web external' band on the main overview graph. This issue has now been fixed. Fix 'rake newrelic:install' for Rails 4 applications The newrelic:install rake task was previously not working for Rails 4 applications and has been fixed. Thanks to Murahashi Sanemat Kenichi for contributing this fix!",

    "description": "The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see Update the agent . For more information, see End-of-life policy . Notes Rack middleware instrumentation The Ruby agent now automatically instruments Rack middlewares! This means that the agent can now give you a more complete picture of your application's response time, including time spent in middleware. It also means that requests which previously weren't captured by the agent because they never made it to the bottom of your middleware stack (usually a Rails or Sinatra application) will now be captured. After installing this version of the Ruby agent, you'll see a new 'Middleware' band on your application's overview graph, and individual middlewares will appear in transaction breakdown charts and transaction traces. The agent can instrument middlewares that are added from a config.ru file via Rack::Builder, or via Rails' middleware stack in Rails 3.0+. This instrumentation may be disabled with the disable_middlware_instrumentation configuration setting. For more details, see the documentation for this feature: http://docs.newrelic.com/docs/ruby/rack-middlewares http://docs.newrelic.com/docs/ruby/middleware-upgrade-changes Capistrano 3.x support Recording application deployments using Capistrano 3.x is now supported. Many thanks to Jennifer Page for the contribution! Better support for Sidekiq's Delayed extensions Sidekiq jobs executed via the Delayed extensions (e.g. the #delay method) will now be named after the actual class that #delay was invoked against, and will have their job arguments correctly captured if the sidekiq.capture_params configuration setting is enabled. Many thanks to printercu for the contribution! Improved Apdex calculation with ignored error classes Previously, a transaction resulting in an exception that bubbled up to the top level would always be counted as failing for the purposes of Apdex calculations (unless the transaction name was ignored entirely). Now, exceptions whose classes have been ignored by the error_collector.ignore_errors configuration setting will not cause a transaction to be automatically counted as failing. Allow URIs that are not parseable by stdlib's URI if addressable is present There are some URIs that are valid by RFC 3986, but not parseable by Ruby's stdlib URI class. The Ruby agent will now attempt to use the addressable gem to parse URIs if it is present, allowing requests against these problematic URIs to be instrumented. Many thanks to Craig R Webster and Amir Yalon for their help with this issue! More robust error collection from Resque processes Previously, traced errors where the exception class was defined in the Resque worker but not in the Resque master process would not be correctly handled by the agent. This has been fixed. Allow Sinatra apps to set the New Relic environment without setting RACK_ENV The NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable may now be used to specify the environment the agent should use from its configuration file, independently of RACK_ENV. Many thanks to Mario Izquierdo for the contribution! Better error handling in Browser Application Monitoring injection The agent middleware that injects the JavaScript code necessary for Browser Application Monitoring now does a better job of catching errors that might occur during the injection process. Allow disabling of Net::HTTP instrumentation Most instrumentation in the Ruby agent can be disabled easily via a configuration setting. Our Net::HTTP instrumentation was previously an exception, but now it can also be disabled with the disable_net_http configuration setting. Make Rails constant presence check more defensive The Ruby agent now guards against the (rare) case where an application has a Rails constant defined, but no Rails::VERSION constant (because Rails is not actually present). Many thanks to Vladimir Kiselev for the contribution!",

Notes Better handling for Rack applications implemented as middlewares When using a Sinatra application as a middleware around another app (for example, a Rails app), or manually instrumenting a Rack middleware wrapped around another application, the agent would previously generate two separate transaction names in the New Relic UI (one for the middleware, and one for the inner application). As of this release, the agent will instead unify these two parts into a single transaction in the UI. The unified name will be the name assigned to the inner-most traced transaction by default. Calls to NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name will continue to override the default names assigned by the agent's instrumentation code. This change also makes it possible to run X-Ray sessions against transactions of the 'inner' application in cases where one instrumented app is wrapped in another that's implemented as a middleware. Support for mongo-1.10.0 The Ruby agent now instruments version 1.10.0 of the mongo gem (versions 1.8.x and 1.9.x were already supported, and continue to be). Allow setting configuration file path via an option to manual_start Previously, passing the :config_path option to NewRelic::Agent.manual_start would not actually affect the location that the agent would use to look for its configuration file. This has been fixed, and the log messages emitted when a configuration file is not found should now be more helpful.",

Notes Better support for forking and daemonizing dispatchers (e.g. Puma, Unicorn) The agent should now work out-of-the box with no special configuration on servers that fork or daemonize themselves (such as Unicorn or Puma in some configurations). The agent's background thread will be automatically restarted after the first transaction processed within each child process. This change means it's no longer necessary to set the 'restart_thread_in_children setting' in your agent configuration file if you were doing so previously. Rails 4.1 support Rails 4.1 has shipped, and the Ruby agent is ready for it! We've been running our test suites against the release candidates with no significant issues, so we're happy to announce full compatibility with this new release of Rails. Ruby VM measurements The Ruby agent now records more detailed information about the performance and behavior of the Ruby VM, mainly focused around Ruby's garbage collector. This information is exposed on the new 'Ruby VM' tab in the UI. For details about what is recorded, see: http://docs.newrelic.com/docs/ruby/ruby-vm-stats Separate in-transaction GC timings for web and background processes Previously, an application with GC instrumentation enabled, and both web and background processes reporting in to it would show an overly inflated GC band on the application overview graph, because data from both web and non-web transactions would be included. This has been fixed, and GC time during web and non-web transactions is now tracked separately. More accurate GC measurements on multi-threaded web servers The agent could previously have reported inaccurate GC times on multi-threaded web servers such as Puma. It will now correctly report GC timings in multi-threaded contexts. Improved ActiveMerchant instrumentation The agent will now trace the store, unstore, and update methods on ActiveMerchant gateways. In addition, a bug preventing ActiveMerchant instrumentation from working on Ruby 1.9+ has been fixed. Thanks to Troex Nevelin for the contribution! More robust Real User Monitoring script injection with charset meta tags Previous versions of the agent with Real User Monitoring enabled could have injected JavaScript code into the page above a charset meta tag. By the HTML5 spec, the charset tag must appear in the first 1024 bytes of the page, so the Ruby agent will now attempt to inject RUM script after a charset tag, if one is present. More robust connection sequence with New Relic servers A rare bug that could cause the agent's initial connection handshake with New Relic servers to silently fail has been fixed, and better logging has been added to the related code path to ease diagnosis of any future issues. Prevent over-counting of queue time with nested transactions When using add_transaction_tracer on methods called from within a Rails or Sinatra action, it was previously possible to get inflated queue time measurements, because queue time would be recorded for both the outer transaction (the Rails or Sinatra action) and the inner transaction (the method given to add_transaction_tracer). This has been fixed, so only the outermost transaction will now record queue time.",

An issue with ensure_index when passed a symbol or string was also fixed. Thanks Maxime RETY for the report! More accurate error tracing in Rails 4 Traced errors in Rails 4 applications will now be correctly associated with the transaction they occurred in, and custom attributes attached to the transaction will be correctly attached to the traced error as well. More accurate partial-rendering metrics for Rails 4 View partials are now correctly treated as sub-components of the containing template render in Rails 4 applications, meaning that the app server breakdown graphs for Rails 4 transactions should be more accurate and useful. Improved Unicorn 4.8.0 compatibility A rare issue that could lead to spurrious traced errors on app startup for applications using Unicorn 4.8.0 has been fixed. meta_request gem compatibility An incompatibility with the meta_request gem has been fixed. Typhoeus 0.6.4+ compatibility A potential crash with Typhoeus 0.6.4+ when passing a URI object instead of a String instance to one of Typhoeus's HTTP request methods has been fixed. Sequel single threaded mode fix The agent will no longer attempt to run EXPLAIN queries for slow SQL statements issued using the Sequel gem in single-threaded mode, since doing so could potentially cause crashes.

Harvest thread restarts for forked and daemonized processes Historically framework specific code was necessary for the Ruby agent to successfully report data after an app forked or daemonized.

See New Relic on Rubinius  for the most up-to-date status. RUM injection updates The Ruby agent's code for both automatic and manual injection of Real User Monitoring scripts has been improved. No application changes are required, but the new injection logic is simpler, faster, more robust, and paves the way for future improvements to Real User Monitoring. More robust communication with New Relic Failures when transmitting data to New Relic could cause data to be held over unnecessarily to a later harvest. This has been improved both to handle errors more robustly and consistently, and to send data as soon as possible. Fix for agent not restarting on server-side config changes A bug in 3.6.9 caused the agent to not reset correctly after server-side config changes.

More details: https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/ruby-agent-configuration Fix a race condition affecting some Rails applications at startup Some Rails applications using 'newrelic_rpm' were affected by a race condition at startup that manifested as an error when model classes with associations were first loaded.

Notes Better Sinatra Support A number of improvements have been made to our Sinatra instrumentation. More details: https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/sinatra-support-in-the-ruby-agent Sinatra instrumentation has been updated to more accurately reflect the final route that was actually executed, taking pass and conditions into account. New Relic middlewares for error collection, real user monitoring, and cross application tracing are automatically inserted into the middleware stack. Ignoring routes, similar to functionality available to Rails controllers, is now available in Sinatra as well. Routes in 1.4 are properly formatting in transaction names. Thanks Zachary Anker for the contribution! Padrino Support Along with improving our support of Sinatra, we've also extended that to supporting Padrino, a framework that builds on Sinatra. Web transactions should show up in New Relic now for Padrino apps automatically. The agent has been tested against the latest Padrino in versions 0.11.x and 0.10.x. Main overview graph only shows web transactions In the past database times from background jobs mixed with other web transaction metrics in the main overview graph. This often skewed graphs. A common workaround was to send background jobs to a separate application, but that should no longer be necessary as the overview graphs now only represent web transactions.",

See https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/sequel-instrumentation  for full details. Thread profiling fix The prior release of the agent (version 3.6.1) broke thread profiling. A profile would appear to run, but return no data. This has been fixed. Fix for over-counted Net::HTTP calls Under some circumstances, calls into Net::HTTP were being counted twice in metrics and transaction traces. This has been fixed. Missing traced errors for Resque applications Traced errors weren't displaying for some Resque workers, although the errors were factored into the overall count graphs.

Notes Full URIs for HTTP requests are recorded in transaction traces When recording a transaction trace node for an outgoing HTTP call via Net::HTTP, the agent will now save the full URI (instead of just the hostname) for the request. Embedded credentials, the query string, and the fragment will be stripped from the URI before it is saved. Simplify Agent Autostart Logic Previously the agent would only start when it detected a supported \"Dispatcher\", meaning a known web server or background task framework. This was problematic for customers using webservers that the agent was not configured to detect (e.g. Puma). Now the agent will attempt to report any time it detects it is running in a monitored environment (e.g. production). There are two exceptions to this. The agent will not autostart in a rails console or irb session or when the process was invoked by a rake task (e.g. rake assets:precompile). The NEWRELIC_ENABLE environment variable can be set to true or false to force the agent to start or not start. Don't attempt to resolve collector hostname when proxy is in use When a proxy is configured, the agent will not attempt to lookup and cache the IP address of New Relic server to which it is sending data, since DNS may not be available in some environments. Thanks to Bill Kirtley for the contribution Added NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name Ordinarily the name of your transaction is defined up-front, but if you'd like to change the name of a transaction while it is still running you can use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name() . Similarly, if you need to know the name of the currently running transaction, you can use NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name() .",

Notes Sidekiq supprt The Ruby agent now supports the Sidekiq background job framework. Traces from Sidekiq jobs will automatically show up in the Background tasks on New Relic similar to Resque and Delayed::Job tasks. Improved thread safety The primary metrics data structures in the Ruby agent are now thread safe. This should provide better reliability for the agent under JRuby and threaded scenarios such as Sidekiq or Puma. More robust environment report The agent's analysis of the local environment (e.g. OS, Processors, loaded gems) will now work in a wider variety of app environments, including Sinatra. Experimental Rainbows! support The Ruby agent now automatically detects and instruments the Rainbows! web server. This support is considered experimental at present, and has not been tested with all dispatch modes. Thanks to Joseph Chen for the contribution. Fix a potential file descriptor leak in Resque instrumentation A file descriptor leak that occurred when DontPerform exceptions were used to abort processing of a job has been fixed.

Notes Use HTTPS by default The agent now defaults to using SSL when it communicates with New Relic's servers. By defaults already configured, New Relic does not transmit any sensitive information (e.g. SQL parameters are masked), but SSL adds another layer of security. Upgrading customers may need to remove the \"ssl: false\" directive from their newrelic.yml to enable ssl. Customers on Jruby may need to install the jruby-openssl gem to take advantage of this feature. Fix two Resque-related issues Fixes a possible hang on exit of an instrumented Resque master process (https://github.com/resque/resque/issues/578 ), as well as a file descriptor leak that could occur during startup of the Resque master process. Fix for error graph over 100% Some errors were double counted toward the overall error total. This resulted in graphs with error percentages over 100%. This duplication did not impact the specific error traces captured, only the total metric. Notice gracefully handled errors in Sinatra When show_exceptions was set to false in Sinatra, errors weren't caught by New Relic's error collector. Now handled errors also have the chance to get reported back. Ruby 2.0 compatibility fixes Ruby 2.0 no longer finds protected methods by default, but will with a flag. http://tenderlovemaking.com/2012/09/07/protected-methods-and-ruby-2-0.html Thanks Ravil Bayramgalin and Charlie Somerville for the fixes. Auto-detect Trinidad as dispatcher Code already existing for detecting Trinidad as a dispatcher, but was only accessible via an ENV variable. This now auto-detects on startup. Thanks Robert Rasmussen for catching that. Coercion of types in collector communication Certain metrics can be recorded with a Ruby Rational type, which JSON serializes as a string rather than a floating point value. We now treat coerce each outgoing value, and log issues before sending the data. Developer mode fix for chart error Added require to fix a NameError in developer mode for summary page. Thanks to Ryan B. Harvey. Don't touch deprecated RAILS_ROOT if on Rails 3 Under some odd startup conditions, we would look for the RAILS_ROOT constant after failing to find the ::Rails.root in a Rails 3 app, causing deprecation warnings.

Notes Add thread profiling support Thread profiling performs statistical sampling of backtraces of all threads within your Ruby processes. This feature requires CRuby >= 1.9.2, and is controlled via the New Relic web UI. JRuby support (in 1.9.x compat mode) is considered experimental, due to issues with JRuby's Thread#backtrace. Add audit logging capability The agent can now log all of the data it sends to the New Relic servers to a special log file for human inspection. This feature is off by default, and can be enabled by setting the audit_log.enabled configuration key to true. You may also control the location of the audit log with the audit_log.path key. Use config system for dispatcher, framework, and config file detection Several aspects of the agent's configuration were not being handled by the configuration system. Detection/configuration of the dispatcher (e.g. passenger, unicorn, resque), framework (e.g. rails3, sinatra), and newrelic.yml location are now handled via the Agent environment, manual, and default configuration sources. Updates to logging across the agent We've carefully reviewed the logging messages that the agent outputs, adding details in some cases, and removing unnecessary clutter. We've also altered the startup sequence to ensure that we don't spam STDOUT with messages during initialization. Fix passing environment to manual_start() Thanks to Justin Hannus. The :env key, when passed to Agent.manual_start, can again be used to specify which section of newrelic.yml is loaded. Rails 4 support This release includes preliminary support for Rails 4 as of 4.0.0.beta.

Fixes Add queue time support for sinatra apps Sinatra applications can now take advantage of frontend queue time reporting. Thanks to Winfield Peterson for this contribution. Simplify queue time configuration for nginx 1.2.6+ Beginning in version 1.2.6, recently released as a development version, the $msec variable can be used to set an http header. This change allows frontend queue time to be tracked in New Relic simply by adding this line to the nginx config: proxy_set_header X-Queue-Start \"t=${msec}000\" It will no longer be necessary to compile a patched version of nginx or compile in the perl or lua module to enable this functionality. Thanks to Lawrence Pit for the contribution. Report back build number and stage along with version info In the 3.5.3 series the agent would fail to report its full version number to NewRelic's environment report. For example it would report its version as 3.5.3 instead of 3.5.3.25 or 3.5.3.25.beta. The agent will now report its complete version number as defined in newrelic_rpm.gemspec. The host and the port that the agent reports to can now be set from environment vars The host can be set with NEW_RELIC_HOST and the port with NEW_RELIC_PORT. These setting will overrride any other settings in your newrelic.yml.

Fixes (Fix) RUM Stops Working After 3.4.2.1 Agent Upgrade v3.4.2.1 introduced a bug that caused the browser monitor auto instrumentation (for RUM) default to be false. The correct value of true is now used When the Ruby Agent detects Unicorn as the dispatcher it creates an INFO level log message with additional information To help customers using Unicorn, if the agent detects it (Unicorn) is being used as the dispatcher an INFO level log message it created that includes a link to New Relic online doc that has additional steps that may be required to get performance data reporting. (Fix) In version 3.4.2 of the Ruby Agent the server side value for Apdex T was disgregarded With version 3.4.2 of the agent, the value set in the newrelic.yml file took precedence over the value set in the New Relic UI. As of version 3.5.0 only the value for Apdex T set in the New Relic UI will be used. Any setting in the yaml file will be ignored. Improved Error Detection/Reporting capabilities for Rails 3 apps Some errors are missed by the agent's exception reporting handlers because they are generated in the rails stack, outside of the instrumented controller action. A Rack middleware is now included that can detect these errors as they bubble out of the middleware stack. Note that this does not include Routing Errors. The Ruby Agent now logs certain information it receives from the New Relic servers After connecting to the New Relic servers the agent logs the New Relic URL of the app it is reporting to. GC profiling overhead for Ruby 1.9 reduced For Ruby 1.9 the amount of time spent in GC profiling has been reduced. Know issue with Ruby 1.8.7-p334, sqlite3-ruby 1.3.0 or older, and resque 1.23.0 The Ruby Agent will not work in conjunction with Ruby 1.8.7-p334, sqlite3-ruby 1.3.3 or earlier, and resque 1.23.0. Your app will likely stop functioning. This is a known problem with Ruby versions up to 1.8.7-p334. Upgrading to the last release of Ruby 1.8.7 is recommended. This issue has been present in every version of the agent we've tested going back for a year.",

    "description": "v3.18.0 Ruby 2.4.0 support The agent is now tested against the official release of ruby 2.4.0, excluding incompatible packages. Agent-based metrics will not be recorded outside of active transactions The agent has historically recorded metrics outside of a transaction. In practice, this usually occurs in applications that run background job processors. The agent would record metrics for queries the background job processor is making between transactions. This can lead to display issues on the background overview page and the presence of metrics generated by the background job processor can mask the application generated metrics on the database page. The agent will no longer generate metrics outside of a transaction. Custom metrics recorded using NewRelic::Agent.record_metric will continue to be recorded regardless of whether there is an active transaction. Include ControllerInstrumentation module with ActiveSupport.on_load The agent will now use the on_load :action_controller hook to include the ControllerInstrumentation module in to both the Base and API classes of ActionController for Rails 5. This ensures that the proper load order is retained, minimizing side-effects of having the agent in an application. Ensure values for revisions on Capistrano deploy notices Previously, running the task to look up the changelog could generate an error, if there weren't previous and current revisions defined.

Early Access Sinatra 2.0 instrumentation Our Sinatra instrumentation has been updated to work with Sinatra 2.0.0.beta2. Include controller instrumentation module in Rails 5 API The agent now includes the ControllerInstrumentation module into ActionController::API. This gives Rails API controllers access to helper methods like newrelic_ignore in support of the existing event-subscription-based action instrumentation. Thanks Andreas Thurn for the contribution! Use Module#prepend for ActiveRecord 5 Instrumentation Rails 5 deprecated the use of alias_method_chain in favor of using Module#prepend. Mixing Module#prepend and alias_method_chain can lead to a SystemStackError when an alias_method_chain is applied after a module has been prepended. This should ensure better compatibility between our ActiveRecord Instrumentation and other third party gems that modify ActiveRecord using Module#prepend. Use license key passed in to NewRelic::Agent.manual_start Previously, the license key passed in when manually starting the agent with NewRelic::Agent.manual_start was not referenced when setting up the connection to report data to New Relic. This is now fixed. Account for DataMapper database connection errors Our DataMapper instrumentation traces instances of DataObjects::SQLError being raised and removes the password from the URI attribute. However, when DataObjects cannot connect to the database (ex: could not resolve host), it will raise a DataObjects::ConnectionError. This inherits from DataObjects::SQLError but has nil for its URI attribute, since no connection has been made yet. To avoid the password check here on nil, the agent catches and re-raises any instances of DataObjects::ConnectionError explicitly. Thanks Postmodern for this contribution! Account for request methods that require arguments When tracing a transaction, the agent tries to get the request object from a controller if it wasn't explicitly passed in. However, this posed problems in non-controller transactions with their own request methods defined that required arguments, such as in Resque jobs. This is now fixed.",

    "description": "v3.15.2 Run explain plans on parameterized slow queries in AR4 In our ActiveRecord 4 instrumentation, we moved to tracing slow queries using the payloads from ActiveSupport::Notifications sql.active_record events. As a result, we were unable to run explain plans on parameterized queries. This has now been updated to pass along and use the parameter values, when available, to get the explain plans. Fix getMore metric grouping issue in Mongo 2.2.x instrumentation A metric grouping issue had cropped up when using the most recent Mongo gem (2.2.0) with the most recent release of the server (3.2.4). We now have a more future-proof setup for preventing these. Restore older DataMapper support after password obfuscation fix Back in 3.14.3, we released a fix to avoid inadvertently sending sensitive information from DataMapper SQLErrors. Our implementation did not account for DataMapper versions below v0.10.0 not implementing the #options accessor. Thanks Bram de Vries for the fix to our fix! Padrino 0.13.1 Support Users with Padrino 0.13.x apps were previously seeing the default transaction name \"(unknown)\" for all of their routes. We now provide the full Padrino route template in transaction names, including any parameter placeholders. Thanks Robert Schulze for the contribution! Update transaction naming for Grape 0.16.x In Grape 0.16.x, route_ methods are no longer prefixed. Thanks to Daniel Doubrovkine for the contribution! Fix name collision on method created for default metric name fix We had a name collision with the yard gem, which sets a class_name method on Module.

    "description": "v3.15.1 Rack 2 alpha support This release includes experimental support for Rack 2 as of 2.0.0.alpha. Rack 2 is still in development, but the agent should work as expected for those who are experimenting with Rack 2. Rails 5 beta 3 support We've tweaked our Action View instrumentation to accommodate changes introduced in Rails v5.0.0.beta3. Defer referencing ::ActiveRecord::Base to avoid triggering its autoloading too soon In 3.12.1 and later versions of the agent, the agent references (and therefore loads) ActiveRecord::Base earlier on in the Rails loading process. This could jump ahead of initializers that should be run first. We now wait until ActiveRecord::Base is loaded elsewhere. Fix explain plans for non-parameterized queries with single quote literals The agent does not run explain plans for queries still containing parameters (such as SELECT * FROM UNICORNS WHERE ID = $1 LIMIT 1). This check was unfortunately mutating the query to be obfuscated, causing an inability to collect an explain plan. This has now been fixed. Fix default metric name for tracing class methods When using add_method_tracer on a class method but without passing in a metric_name_code, the default metric name will now look like Custom/ClassName/Class/method_name. We also addressed default metric names for anonymous classes and modules. Fix issue when rendering SQL strings in developer mode When we obfuscate SQL statements, we rewrite the Statement objects as SQL strings inline in our sample buffers at harvest time. However, in developer mode, we also read out of these buffers when rendering pages. Depending on whether a harvest has run yet, the buffer will contain either Statement objects, SQL strings, or a mix. Now, developer mode can handle them all! Fix DelayedJob Sampler reporting incorrect counts in Active Record 3 and below When fixing various deprecation warnings on ActiveRecord 4, we introduced a regression in our DelayedJob sampler which caused us to incorrectly report failed and locked job counts in ActiveRecord 3 and below.

The response time charts in the application overview page will now include NoSQL datastores, such as MongoDB, and also the product name of existing SQL databases such as MySQL, Postgres, etc. The Databases page will now enable the filtering of metrics and operations by product, and includes a table listing all operations. For existing SQL databases, in addition to the existing breakdown of SQL statements and operations, the queries are now also associated with the database product being used. For NoSQL datastores, such as MongoDB, we have now added information about operations performed against those products, similar to what is being done for SQL databases. Because this introduces a notable change to how SQL database metrics are collected, it is important that you upgrade the agent version on all hosts. If you are unable to transition to the latest agent version on all hosts at the same time, you can still access old and new metric data for SQL databases, but the information will be split across two separate views.

Automatic Cross Application Tracing support for all Rack applications Previously Rack apps not using Rails or Sinatra needed to include the AgentHooks middleware to get Cross Application Tracing support. With these changes, this is no longer necessary. Any explicit references to AgentHooks can be removed unless the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting is set to true. Metrics no longer reported from Puma master processes When using Puma's cluster mode with the preload_app! configuration directive, the agent will no longer start its reporting thread in the Puma master process. This should result in more accurate instance counts, and more accurate stats on the Ruby VMs page (since the master process will be excluded). Better support for Sinatra apps used with Rack::Cascade Previously, using a Sinatra application as part of a Rack::Cascade chain would cause all transactions to be named after the Sinatra application, rather than allowing downstream applications to set the transaction name when the Sinatra application returned a 404 response.

New features Add support for asgiref  3.8.0 and above Asgiref released a new version that resulted in missing transaction context. This has been fixed. AI monitoring New Relic AI monitoring is the industry’s first APM solution that provides end-to-end visibility for AI Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It enables end-to-end visibility into the key components of an AI LLM application. With AI monitoring, users can monitor, alert, and debug AI-powered applications for reliability, latency, performance, security and cost. AI monitoring also enables AI/LLM specific insights (metrics, events, logs and traces) which can easily integrate to build advanced guardrails for enterprise security, privacy and compliance. AI monitoring offers custom-built insights and tracing for the complete lifecycle of an LLM’s prompts and responses, from raw user input to repaired/polished responses. AI monitoring provides built-in integrations with popular LLMs and components of the AI development stack. This release provides instrumentation for OpenAI , AWS Bedrock , and Langchain . When AI monitoring is enabled with ai_monitoring.enabled = true, the agent will now capture AI LLM related data. This data will be visible under a new APM tab called AI Responses. See our AI Monitoring documentation  for more details. AI monitoring configuration New configuration options are available specific to AI monitoring .

Add support for dictionary type log messages Dictionary type log messages are now supported for logging frameworks which support dictionary type log messages (including the builtin logging module and structlog). The key message will be extracted if available and treated as the log message, and any other items will be considered context data attributes and prefixed with message.. These attributes are subject to the same filtering rules as other context data. Add attribute support to record_log_event API The record_log_event API now allows passing context data in using the optional attributes keyword argument, and allows the message argument to be a dictionary as described above. Obfuscate license keys and user API keys in logs The agent now obfuscates all instances of license keys or user API keys in agent logs and audit logs.

    "description": "Notes This release of the Python agent adds support for nonced content security policies for browser agent injection, adds new wheels for Python 3.12 and musl Linux systems such as Alpine, deprecates the ObjectWrapper and get_browser_timing_footer APIs, fixes a crash with Kafka instrumentation when using distributed tracing, and removes a case sensitive header check in ASGIBrowserMiddleware. Install the agent using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or download it directly from the New Relic download site . Deprecations Deprecated newrelic.agent.ObjectWrapper API Removes custom newrelic.agent.ObjectWrapper implementation and instead creates a pass through to wrapt.FunctionWrapper. Deprecated get_browser_timing_footer API Previously get_browser_timing_footer was an API that would be used to supply information to the browser agent loaded by get_browser_timing_header. This step is now included in get_browser_timing_header, making get_browser_timing_footer obsolete. This function now returns an empty string to avoid breaking existing applications. New features Added nonced content security policies (CSPs) for browser agent injection The browser agent injection API get_browser_timing_header has a new parameter nonce that takes a cryptographic nonce for use with content security policies. The nonce will be automatically inserted into the generated HTML. Added additional wheel options for Python 3.12 and musl Linux Added pre-built binary wheel support for Python 3.12 as well as alternative wheels for musl-based Linux operating systems (such as Alpine). Added newrelic.agent.CallableObjectProxy to public APIs Previously CallableObjectProxy was never exposed for general use with custom instrumentation, but was present in internal modules used by the agent. This API has been added to newrelic.agent.CallableObjectProxy for general use. Bug fixes Fixed a crash with kafka-python  and confluent-kafka  when using distributed tracing Previously Kafka instrumentation packages would sometimes fail to generate distributed tracing headers and cause a crash. This has been fixed and distributed tracing headers should now generate correctly. Removed case sensitive header check in ASGIBrowserMiddleware The agent previously only supported HTML insertion for headers that were lowercase in ASGI applications. The header check is now case insensitive in compliance with the ASGI specification. Support statement We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available.

Fix confluent-kafka producer arguments Fixes a bug where topic provided as a keyword argument can crash Confluent Kafka producers. Patch sentry SDK to correct ASGI v2/v3 detection Patches sentry-sdk to fix a bug that causes incorrect ASGI application version detection with our wrapt function wrappers. To fix this, we now instrument the _looks_like_asgi3() function to bind out the wrapped app in sentry in order to unwrap it to be able to detect the proper ASGI version. Fix missing information issue with Celery workers when using MAX_TASKS_PER_CHILD A bug was introduced in v7.8.0.174 when Celery was run with the --loglevel=INFO flag to not report any data after the original worker processes shut down.

Install the agent using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or download it directly from the New Relic download site . Version numbering change The version number of the agent did not previously follow Semantic Versioning  properly. This has been changed. Going forward build numbers have been removed from the version number, and version increments will follow semantic versioning fully. No retroactive changes will be made to previous version numbers. Instrumentation updates Update Sanic middleware support Sanic recently changed their APIs surrounding middleware, and instrumentation has been updated to support it. Package updates Update wrapt to v1.14.1 The internal copy of the wrapt library used by the agent has been updated to v1.14.1 for Python 3.11 compatibility. Add support for Protobuf v4 The agent is now fully compatible with Protobuf v4 when using Infinite Tracing. Backwards compatibility with Protobuf v3 has been preserved. Bug fixes Fix a RuntimeError in the trace cache when using the coroutine profiler A RuntimeError occurred if traces were started or stopped while the coroutine profiler was sampling the active traces. This should no longer be possible. Thank you @lovmat  for your contribution! Fix an issue with case sensitivity in record-deploy Previously application names were incorrectly being treated as case-sensitive when running newrelic-admin record-deploy. Thank you @michalborkowski96  for your contribution! Fix an issue with newer installers failing to install the agent Due to the inclusion of both scripts and entry_points configuration options, the agent would fail to install with newer installers. This has been corrected and newer PEP compliant installers should have no trouble installing the agent. Thank you @admp-fh  for your contribution! Fix instrumentation for aioredis interfering with transactions The agent does not currently support transactions for Redis clients, and previous instrumentation broke transaction functionality in AioRedis. This has been fixed to provide no instrumentation within transactions at this time. Fix a crash when completing various kinds of traces inside a stopped transaction Previously certain types of traces could throw exceptions and fail to complete when inside stopped transactions. This has been corrected and should no longer be possible. Fix a bug where instrumentation caused certain arguments to confluent-kafka producers to stop working Previously callback and on_delivery arguments were passed through improperly leading to them not working as expected.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site . Deprecations Deprecated record_exception API record_exception has been superseded by the new notice_error API. The old API will forward exceptions to notice_error with a deprecation warning. Deprecated error_collector.ignore_errors setting error_collector.ignore_errors has been replaced with error_collector.ignore_classes to match other agents. Please update your config files to use the new setting. The old setting will continue to function with a deprecation warning. New Features Added new notice_error API This new API falls much more in line with other language agents . It also includes expected errors  functionality and a status code parameter. To see all changes, view the documentation  for this API. Added new expected errors feature This feature implements expected errors  as documented here. To enable them, use the following new settings. error_collector.expected_classes error_collector.expected_status_codes Improved Features Improved NewRelicContextFormatter Adds new log_record_to_dict function to separate logic for JSON serialization and converting to a dictionary, enabling custom formatters to access the data more easily. Custom attributes now attempt JSON serialization by default and fallback to strings, meaning dictionaries and other serializable types are now supported. Thank you to @chrislawlor  and @qvik-olli  for your contributions! error_collector.ignore_status_codes is now configurable in server-side configuration Previously this setting was only available in the config file, but is now available via server-side configuration. Bug Fixes Infinite tracing crash fix Crashes had occurred in infinite tracing following the inclusion of some startup timeout changes in v6.0.0. These changes have been rolled back. RuntimeInstrumentationError crash removed Crashes occurred when a RuntimeInstrumentationError was reached, indicating a potential problem with existing instrumentation. The exception is now caught and replaced with error level log messages to avoid crashing applications. SQLite instrumentation consumes generator objects passed to executemany A generator passed to Connection.executemany would unexpectedly be consumed by our instrumentation.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site . New features Add new api newrelic.agent.add_custom_span_attribute There is now a public API method allowing users to add custom attributes directly to spans. Improved features External spans now contain HTTP response code External HTTP spans will now contain a new attribute http.statusCode with the http response code for each external call made. This attribute will be added when using any supported HTTP client. Deprecations LambdaHandlerWrapper and lambda_handler APIs are deprecated The Lambda API functionality has been moved to a separate package called newrelic-lambda . All future lambda implementations should use the new package for lambda monitoring. Bug fixes Fix application crash when using a non-WSGI framework with synthetics When synthetic monitors were used with an application utilizing a non-WSGI web framework (such as aiohttp), a crash could have occurred if an outbound HTTP request was attempted from within the transaction. This crash has now been fixed. The Python agent generates an invalid nr tracestate entry Under certain random conditions, the agent may have generated an invalid New Relic w3c tracestate entry, resulting in potentially missing parts of traces. This invalid tracestate entry would not impact propagation of tracestate values from other vendors.

    "description": "Notes This release of the Python agent includes an implementation for w3c trace context, support for uvloop, and various bug fixes. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site . New Features New APIs for creating / accepting distributed trace headers This version of the agent deprecates newrelic.agent.create_distributed_trace_payload and newrelic.agent.accept_distributed_trace_payload in favor of newrelic.agent.insert_distributed_trace_headers and newrelic.agent.accept_distributed_trace_headers. See the Python agent API documentation for details. Support for W3C Trace Context, with easy upgrade from New Relic Trace Context Distributed Tracing now supports W3C Trace Context headers for HTTP and gRPC protocols when distributed tracing is enabled. Our implementation can accept and emit both W3C trace header format and New Relic trace header format. This simplifies agent upgrades, allowing trace context to be propagated between services with older and newer releases of New Relic agents. W3C trace header format will always be accepted and emitted. New Relic trace header format will be accepted, and you can optionally disable emission of the New Relic trace header format. When distributed tracing is enabled with distributed_tracing.enabled = true, the Python agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling accept_distributed_trace_headers. When calling insert_distributed_trace_headers, the Python agent will include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header, unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header = true Also, see the \"Known Issues and Workarounds\" section of these Release notes. Improved Features Add support for uvloop Transaction context may not have been propagated when using uvloop. This could have resulted in incomplete traces or instrumentation failures when using uvloop. uvloop is now supported. Bug Fixes Fix crash when using aiohttp_cors Customers using the agent with aiohttp_cors may have experienced a crash when the aiohttp_cors framework was used in conjunction with aiohttp class based views. This crash has now been fixed. Fix grpc v1.26 instrumentation errors Customers using grpc v1.26 and above may have experienced an error message in the New Relic agent logs indicating there was an instrumentation error. Additionally, some data may have been missing when this error was encountered. This issue has now been fixed. Known Issues and Workarounds If a .NET agent is initiating distributed traces as the root service, you must update that .NET agent to version 8.24 or later before upgrading your downstream New Relic Python agents to this agent release.",

The URL is now parsed correctly in both the YARL url case and the string url case. Data may not be recorded when tornado's RequestHandler.finish Using RequestHandler.finish in tornado caused the transaction to exit before all traces (inserted by automatic instrumentation) were complete, resulting in missing data. All traces now exit when RequestHandler.finish is called. asyncio.ensure_future / asyncio.create_task is unable to spawn new transactions Calling asyncio.create_task / asyncio.ensure_future was unable to spawn a new transaction if these methods were called from within an existing transaction. New transactions can now be created when ensure_future/create_task is called from within an existing transaction and no traces have been started on the spawned task. py3: A runtime instrumentation error may have occurred when transactions were finalized When transactions became garbage (if the reference to the transaction was lost as part of a circular reference for example), a runtime instrumentation error may have been logged. The error conditions have been relaxed to allow for certain states within the agent when a transaction becomes garbage. Application crash when starting a transaction when one is already active Starting a transaction via the context manager APIs when a transaction is already active no longer causes an application crash.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site . Event loop diagnostics Introducing event loop diagnostics for asyncio! The Python agent can now surface information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will be able to generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Event loop diagnostic information will be available in both APM and via NRQL query. Event loop metrics will appear in the transaction Breakdown table : Time spent waiting on other transactions will be shown in the transaction Trace details  page, as shown here: eventLoopTime and eventLoopWait attributes will be available via NRQL query. An example query might be:SELECT count(*) as 'count', average(eventLoopTime) as 'loopTime', average(eventLoopWait) as 'loopWait' FROM Transaction facet name In New Relic Insights, this might show a result like this: Diagnostics will be available by default through our existing aiohttp, sanic, and Tornado instrumentation. Diagnostic information will also be available for coroutines that use our background_task and web_transaction decorator APIs. Tornado 6 Instrumentation Instrumentation for Tornado framework version 6.x is supported without any feature flags. Support for versions earlier than Tornado 6.x has been dropped. The Tornado web server, framework, and http client are instrumented and information will show up in both APM and insights. Important:  Using the tornado.gen.coroutine with instrumentation is not supported. Any usage of tornado.gen.coroutine should be replaced with an asyncio coroutine. Before After Improved APIs for time trace context managers Context managers (such as FunctionTrace, ExternalTrace, DatastoreTrace) may now be used from within asyncio coroutines! Additionally, the transaction argument is no longer used for any context manager API. In order to transition to the new API, the transaction argument must be removed . Before After Updated WebTransaction context manager The WebTransaction context manager is no longer WSGI dependent. The context manager takes generic HTTP arguments, which you can use to build web transactions that appear in the APM product. For more information, see our API documentation .",

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site . Features Distributed tracing support Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through your distributed system. By showing the distributed activity through a unified view, you can troubleshoot and understand a complex system better than ever before. Distributed tracing is available with an APM Pro or equivalent subscription. To see a complete distributed trace, you need to enable the feature on a set of neighboring services. Enabling distributed tracing changes the behavior of some New Relic features, so carefully consult the transition guide  before you enable this feature. To enable distributed tracing, add distributed_tracing.enabled = true to your newrelic.ini file or use the environment variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site . Features @background_task can now be used with coroutines The background_task decorator API can now be used with native coroutines and generators. Add support for collection of Kubernetes metadata The agent will now collect environment variables prefixed by NEW_RELIC_METADATA_ as additional metadata. Some of this metadata may be added to Transaction events to provide context between your Kubernetes cluster and your services. For details on the benefits (currently in beta) see this blog post . The agent now also collects the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST environment variable to detect when the application is running on Kubernetes. The data is used to link the application to the host machine when using the New Relic infrastructure product. Bug Fixes Using time trace decorators allowed coroutines to become Iterables and generators to become awaitables When using time trace decorators native coroutines were converted to iterables. Additionally generators were converted to awaitables. The behavior of generators, native coroutines, and awaitable generators is now unchanged when using time trace decorators.",

Features Add ability to exclude attributes from span events and transaction trace segments This release adds support to exclude attributes (such as http.url) from span events (via the span_events.include/span_events.exclude options) and from transaction segments (via the transaction_segments.include/transaction_segments.exclude option). As with other attribute destinations, these new options will inherit values from the top-level attributes.include/attributes.exclude settings. See the documentation for more information. Add public add_custom_parameters API The method add_custom_parameters on Transaction is now exposed through newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameters Bug Fixes Transaction counts were not reported for aiohttp's built-in error pages When a built-in error route was reached in aiohttp (such as a 404 due to a missing route), transactions were not recorded. As a result, the transaction counts may have been artificially low. aiohttp system route traffic will now be reported. aiohttp cross application tracing linking to non-Python applications may have been omitted if using multidict<3.0 For aiohttp users using multidict versions less than 3.0, cross application tracing HTTP headers may have been generated in a way that was incompatible with non-Python applications. Headers are now generated in a format compatible with all New Relic agents. aiohttp 3.5.x versions generated agent instrumentation errors The agent previously failed to instrument aiohttp applications running versions 3.5.0 and greater.

    "description": "The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see Update the agent . For more information, see End-of-life policy . Notes This release of the Python agent marks the official introduction of support for pypy. Instrumentation has also been updated to address issues arising from the release of Celery 3.1. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New Features: The agent has worked with and has already been used by customers with pypy for some time, but we have not officially acknowledged that we support pypy. We have now integrated pypy into our test procedures and now officially support this implementation of the Python language. Bug fixes/Improvements: Instrumentation for Celery has been updated to accommodate changes in Celery 3.1. The changes in Celery 3.1 resulted in no metrics being reported in prior versions of the agent. When collecting data on external web service calls, the agent now drops port 80/443 from the name of the host when used with the standard http/https protocol schemes. This ensures that a URL with or without the ports are seen as the same service in the external web services page in the UI. When using newrelic.agent.initialize() explicitly, if no arguments are provided, the values for the config file and environment arguments will now be read from the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE and NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT arguments if specified. Flask instrumentation was not correctly mapping URLs related to a HTTP 404 response to a known framework or application handler function. Instead the web transaction was named after the URL, which could result in metric grouping issues if an application was hit with a large number of URLs which couldn't be mapped by the application. Such requests will now be mapped to flask.app:Flask.handle_http_exception. Pyramid instrumentation should no longer report as errors instances of exceptions derived from HTTPRedirection, raised to generate a HTTP redirect response. Improvements to the newrelic-admin wrapper script and agent bootstrapping procedure to better deal with a local sitecustomize.py file. Changes will also better handle the case where the newrelic-admin wrapper script was used around a Python script using a different Python installation than that which the newrelic package was installed in, avoiding possible errors when the wrapped script was run, due to the mismatch.",

Tornado 4 ZeroMQ IOLoop support Using ZMQIOLoop in place of the default Tornado IOLoop is now supported for Tornado 4 applications. Improved Feature Improved transaction names for Django REST Framework When using the Python agent with Django REST Framework and Python 3, function-based views wrapped with the rest_framework.decorators.api_view decorator would result in transactions with names based on the decorator (WrappedAPIView.handler) rather than names based on the original view function.

    "description": "Notes This release of the Python agent adds support for reporting datastore instance information for the python-memcached  library. It also addresses a couple of Python 3 issues related to naming metrics and transactions. Over the past few releases, support has been added to the agent for collecting datastore instance information for a number of drivers. See a complete list of supported packages . The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic download site . New Features Datastore instance information for python-memcached For most memcached operations made using the python-memcached  package, the Python agent will collect the host and port of the memcached server, as well as the memcached database index number. This data will be displayed in transaction traces and in slow query traces in APM. Supported operations include: add, append, cas, decr, delete, get, gets, incr, prepend, replace, set. Currently, the Python agent does not collect instance information for operations that interact with multiple memcached instances. These include: delete_multi, flush_all, get_multi, get_slabs, get_stats, set_multi. Bug Fixes Names for subclass methods in Python 3 Previously, when using Python 3, if a method was defined on a base class, but was called as a method on an instance of a subclass, the agent would generate a metric name or transaction name for that method using the base class. It would also use the module name of the base class in the metric or transaction name. With this release, the metric name or transaction name will use the class name of the subclass, as well as the module name of the subclass. This is consistent with how the naming works for Python 2. Names for Flask pluggable views in Python 3 When monitoring Python 3 Flask applications, the agent would create metric and transaction names for Flask pluggable (or, class-based) views using the name of the View.as_view() classmethod, making it impossible to distinguish between different views in APM. Now, the metric and transaction name uses the name that is passed into View.as_view(). For example, a view defined as view_func=ShowUsersView.as_view('show_users') would use show_users as the view name. This is consistent with how the naming works for Python 2. Redis client with custom connection pool If a custom connection pool was used with the redis  client, the agent could throw an AttributeError when attempting to gather datastore instance information. One library known to define a custom connection pool that encountered this issue is Redis Blaster . With this release, the agent will no longer throw an error for custom connection pools. In addition, the agent will now be able to gather datastore instance information for some operations, even when using a custom connection pool. Developer Mode error message during \"fake\" harvest When using the configuration setting of developer_mode = True, the agent does not transmit any data to New Relic. Instead, it performs a \"fake harvest\". In some cases, it was possible for the agent to log an AssertionError during the \"fake harvest\", but this issue has now been fixed.",

    "description": "Notes This release of the Python agent adds support for the improved Django middleware introduced in Django v1.10, and also adds instrumentation for the boto3 and awscli packages. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from our download site . New Features Django 1.10 Middleware Support As described in Django Enhancement Proposal 5  and in the Django v1.10 middleware documentation , Django introduced a new style of middleware in version 1.10. Previously, Django allowed you to define certain methods on middleware classes: process_request() methods would run before the view handler was invoked, and process_response() methods would run after the response was generated. Accordingly, the Python agent would instrument these as separate, self-contained methods, and in the Transaction Trace Details view, they would be displayed at the same level as the view handler in the segments hierarchy. With the improved version in Django v1.10, the middleware classes form a \"chain\", and each middleware calls the next middleware, until it reaches the end of the chain and calls the actual view. This means that new-style middleware acts as a wrapper, and each one is nested inside the previous one. As a result, in the Transaction Trace Details view, each middleware will be nested inside the previous one, and the actual view handler will be displayed nested inside the innermost middleware class. Furthermore, the duration of each middleware segment will include the duration of the middleware nested inside it. Because Django v1.10 is backwards-compatible with the old-style middleware, the agent also supports instrumenting old-style middleware in Django v1.10 Boto3 and AWS CLI Support With this release, API calls to Amazon Web Services endpoints made with the boto3 and awscli packages will be recorded as External Traces and will be visible in the External Services tab in APM. This is achieved by instrumenting the botocore library, which both boto3 and awscli utilize. Bug Fixes Proxy Scheme Output of network-config Command Prior to this release, the newrelic-admin network-config command would output the incorrect proxy scheme. That is now fixed. Debug Console Works with Python 3 The newrelic-admin debug-console is now compatible with Python 3.",

    "description": "Notes This release of the Python agent is a bug fix release that addresses several recently reported issues. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from our download site . Bug Fixes WebSocket requests could cause application errors When an application is using gevent-websocket  to serve a mixture of WSGI and WebSocket endpoints, it is possible for WebSocket requests to interfere with the instrumentation of non-WebSocket requests, and cause application errors. While a fix  for this has been added to the 'gevent-websocket` main branch, that fix has not been released to PyPI yet. To address the problem now, the Python agent explicitly ignores WebSocket requests. Disabling browser monitoring inadvertently disabled other features Disabling browser monitoring had the unintended effect of disabling certain other Response-related features of the agent. Specifically, the response.status attribute was not recorded, and the Cross Application Tracing  headers were not added to the HTTP headers of the outgoing response. With this release, those features now work when using the configuration setting of browser.monitoring.enabled = False. Calling a Celery task within another task could cause a RuntimeError The Python agent would throw a RuntimeError('transaction already active') when instrumenting a Celery task that performed the following combination of actions: Utilized the agent API to end the transaction early (end_of_transaction ), or to ignore the transaction altogether (ignore_transaction ). After ending or ignoring the transaction, called another Celery task that would run synchronously. This scenario, which most commonly occurs when taking advantage of Celery Workflows  to compose multiple tasks together, will no longer result in a RuntimeError.",

    "description": "Notes This release of the Python agent is a bug fix release that addresses several outstanding issues. In addition, the agent's instrumentation for the Pyramid web framework was updated to handle changes introduced in version 1.7 of Pyramid. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see Status of the Python agent . New Feature Support for Pyramid 1.7 In version 1.7 of the Pyramid web framework, the ViewDeriver class was removed and replaced with a custom view pipeline, composed with view derivers. This required a change to where the agent applied it's instrumentation, since we were previously instrumenting the ViewDeriver class. Bug Fixes Gevent and Python 3.4+ When running the agent with gevent in Python 3.4+, the agent would throw an AttributeError when accessing the _sleep attribute in the threading module, which was removed in Python 3.4. The agent now handles this properly. Possible missing application exceptions in APM Error Analytics Using the record_exception() API, it is possible to record an exception against the application, but outside of a transaction. If there was a time window in which no transaction exceptions were recorded, but only application exceptions were recorded, then no exceptions would be displayed when viewing that time window in APM Error Analytics. With this release, application exceptions show up as expected, whether or not transaction exceptions were also recorded. CherryPyWSGIServer and keyword arguments Previously, the agent would fail to instrument CherryPyWSGIServer correctly when it was initialized using keyword arguments. That is now handled correctly. Missing attributes in Transaction Events In version 2.60.0.46  of the agent, two response header attributes were renamed, but they were not added to Transaction Events as they should have been. response.headers.contentLength response.headers.contentType These attributes are now included in Transaction Events. Changed Feature Capture port for all HTTP requests to External Services Prior to this release, the agent would capture the port for HTTP requests to external services for only some of the HTTP libraries that the agent instruments. Notably, the port was missing when using these libraries directly: httplib, httplib2, and urllib3. The agent now captures the port for these libraries.",

    "description": "Notes This release of the Python agent is a bug fix release which improves our introductory support for instrumenting Tornado 4 applications. Full details about the status of our Tornado 4 support can be found on our Introductory Tornado 4 support  page. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see Status of the Python agent . New Feature New attributes captured for Tornado 4 applications The following attributes are now captured for requests made to Tornado 4 applications: request.headers.accept request.headers.host port Bug Fixes Potentially too many metrics created for tornado.httpclient function traces The tornado.httpclient instrumentation for Tornado 4 applications could cause a \"metric grouping issue\"  in the function traces it created, if it was used to make requests to a large number of unique URLs. To address this issue, the URL is no longer included in the name of the function trace. Transactions in Tornado 4 applications could be created with invalid agent settings In the prior release, if a transaction started before the agent had completed registration with the collector, the transaction could have invalid settings, which would result in various errors in the agent log, including an AttributeError when an external call was made during the transaction. These errors only happened at application startup until registration was complete. With this release, transactions cannot start with invalid settings. The httplib2 instrumentation did not process the cross application tracing headers in the response Failing to process the response headers resulted in the inability to link to cross application tracing details in the Transaction Trace Details view , as well as missing ExternalTransaction and ExternalApp metrics. Now, the httplib2 instrumentation in the agent processes the cross application tracing headers correctly. Known Tornado 4 Limitations Addressed Explain plans for queries made with psycopg2's \"async mode\" are disabled automatically Currently, the Python agent does not support explain plans for queries made in psycopg2's \"async mode.\" In the prior release, it was necessary to add the configuration setting transaction_tracer.explain_enabled = false to disable explain plans, or else errors would occur during data harvest, potentially causing loss of data. With this release, the agent disables explain plans automatically when async mode is detected. Added support for synthetics transaction traces Tornado 4 applications will now recognize incoming requests from synthetics and generate transaction traces for Synthetic requests . Status of Tornado 4 Support A current list of known limitations can be found on our Introductory Tornado 4 support  page. No new known limitations have been added since our introductory release (v2.62.0.47). In the next few releases, we plan to continue addressing these issues.",

For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see Status of the Python agent . New Feature Introductory Support for Tornado 4. (See below for details.) Bug Fix Django Template Tags for Browser Monitoring Fixed for Django 1.9 For manual insertion of the browser monitoring javascript for page load timing, the Python agent offers two Django template tags: newrelic_browser_timing_header and newrelic_browser_timing_footer. Starting in Django version 1.9 , the output of simple_tag is now escaped, which results in the browser monitoring javascript being included as escaped text in the HTML output. To fix this issue, the agent now uses django.utils.safestring:mark_safe() to prevent automatic escaping for these two template tags. Introductory Support for Tornado 4 New Relic is pleased to announce introductory support for Tornado 4. While not all features are supported at this point, providing it at an early stage allows interested customers to preview our Tornado 4 support, and provide feedback on what works well and what doesn't. We strongly advise running the introductory Tornado 4 instrumentation in a testing or staging environment before considering using it in a production environment. For detailed information about the introductory Tornado 4 support, including Supported Features, Design Decisions, and Known Limitations, see Introductory Tornado 4 support . Status of Tornado 4 Support The following is a list of known limitations for our Tornado 4 support as it exists in the current version of the agent. In the next few releases, we plan to address these issues. If you use psycopg2 in aynchronous mode, you must disable explain plans in the Python agent, or else the agent will throw an error when it attempts to run an explain plan query. Add this setting to your newrelic.ini configuration file: Metric names should be more consistent. For a method of a class, the metric name should contain both the name of the class and the method, but sometimes, the metric name will be missing the class name. The nesting of segments in a Transaction Trace should be improved. Right now, transaction traces give a good indication of the order that callbacks run on the IOLoop, but they do not group together callbacks that belong to the same coroutine, nor do they show how callbacks relate to each other. Transaction Traces mislabel time spent in \"Application code\". Because the Tornado 4 instrumentation traces all callbacks that run on the IOLoop, nearly everything that happens in a transaction is recorded. Very little is uninstrumented \"Application code\". When you see \"Application code\" time in a transaction trace, that usually means that the IOLoop was either busy running callbacks belonging to another transaction, or was waiting and not doing any work. This will be made clearer in a future release. In the current version of the agent, the Total Time for a transaction will always equal the duration of the transaction. In future versions, we may begin measuring the time spent waiting for asynchronous External Traces and Datastore Traces to return results, which will increase the Total Time for a transaction, making it possible to have a Total Time greater than the duration of the transaction. When using tornado.httpclient, no Cross Application Tracing headers are added to the outgoing requests. (This is true for both HTTPClient and AsyncHTTPClient.) That means that the application that the httpclient connects to will not show up in any of the following: trace maps, transaction maps, and service maps. Asynchronous External Traces only trace the initial HTTP connection. They do not trace the time for the response to come back. If you monitor your Tornado 4 application with synthetic monitoring, the Python agent will not capture transaction traces for synthetic checks, so you will be unable to connect your synthetic results to APM transaction traces. Measuring thread utilization is disabled for Tornado applications. Exceptions thrown in RequestHandler.initialize() are not recorded. Use of Tornado's built-in multi-process mode to start multiple processes and have them all share the same port is untested and unsupported. Use of tornado.wsgi.WSGIAdapter and tornado.wsgi.WSGIContainer is untested and unsupported. Use of tornado.platform.asyncio to bridge between asyncio and Tornado IOLoop is untested and unsupported. Currently, the agent only supports the use of the tornado.ioloop.IOLoop. Use of the async and await keywords is untested and unsupported. Integration with Twisted is untested and unsupported.",

    "description": "The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see Update the agent . For more information, see End-of-life policy . Notes This release of the Python agent contains support for web applications and worker processes using 'gearman' for background task execution. The agent also switches to using the 'json' package from the standard library instead of a separate 'simplejson' package. This should result in potential reductions in base level memory usage by the agent and a reduction of CPU overhead for some environments. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New Features: Instrumentation now provided for the gearman  package. The support covers use of both the gearman client and worker interfaces. In the case of workers, each task executed by the worker will be recorded as a background task and be displayed as such in the New Relic UI. The ignore_errors argument to newrelic.agent.record_exception() can now be a callable in addition to being able to pass a sequence. When it is a callable, the callback will be called with the three arguments exc, value and tb, being the same values as returned by sys.exc_info(). The callback should return True if the exception is to be ignored. False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None. Bug fixes/Improvements: The bundled 'simplejson' package has now been removed and is no longer used. This was previously used due to the requirement to support Python 2.5, for which support was removed in version 2.0.0 of the agent. Instead of simplejson, the 'json' package contained in the Python standard library is now used instead. This should see the base level memory usage of the agent drop as a result. Further, in environments where a C compiler was not available and the C extension modules could not be compiled, there should now be a minimal reduction in the CPU overhead when the agent is uploading data to our backend. This is because the optimised C extension in the json package will always be available as part of the Python standard library and will always be able to be used. If a WSGI application was returning an iterable such as a generator, and an exception was raised when a specific part of the response content was yielded from the generator, the details of the exceptions were not being recorded. In a multithreaded web application where deferred module imports were being performed in secondary threads, agent registration could fail the first time due to concurrent changes made by the secondary threads to sys.modules. Registration would succeed on a subsequent attempt. This bug was only occurring in Python 2 and was introduced in version 2.0.0 of the agent when Python 3 support was added. Custom parameters which were explicitly supplied to newrelic.agent.record_exception() were being ignored and were not appearing in the error details page in the UI. Instead, only custom parameters added using newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameters() against the web transaction or background task itself were being shown. This bug was introduced in version 1.13.0 of the agent when support for cross application tracing was added. The port number used in the URL for a web external call, was not being retained when the URL was added as a parameter against the web external node for transaction traces. The port would therefore not be displayed when drilling down into the details of a web external node in a transaction trace. The newrelic-admin validate-config command will now work for enterprise high-security mode accounts, provided of course that no setting is otherwise specified in the agent configuration file which is in conflict with that mode. That is, features such as SSL would still need to be enabled by the ssl setting and the capture_params setting indicating whether URL query string parameters should be captured, also set to false. When using CherryPy, in addition to the explicit exception type 'NotFound' being ignored as an error, raising of a 'HTTPError' exception where the status is 404 will also be ignored. Similarly, instances of the 'HTTPError' exception will be ignored as an error when they are for a HTTP error in the 30X range.",

For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see Status of the Python agent . Bug Fix If the Python agent was used in an environment where the certifi package was installed, the Python agent would use the certifi CA certificates bundle to validate the certificate of the New Relic collector. However, the latest release of certifi (November 20, 2015) removed some older CA certificates with 1024-bit keys. The SSL certificate for the New Relic collector is cross-signed with both a 1024-bit certificate and a 2048-bit certificate, but in some circumstances, the stronger root certificate was not used for validation. When the 1024-bit certificate was no longer included in the certifi bundle, SSL validation would fail. Affected customers would see warnings in their agent log stating \"Data collector is not contactable\" due to an SSLError. To address this issue, the agent no longer uses the certifi CA certificates bundle, nor the certificates bundled with requests. Instead, it only uses the CA bundle included with the agent to validate the New Relic collector certificate.",

    "description": "Notes This release of the Python agent adds instrumentation for Elasticsearch as a new datastore product and a more granular breakdown of various SQL operations in the “Databases” tab in the APM UI. In addition, the stack traces captured by the agent are now being trimmed to remove any code snippets. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see Status of the Python agent . New Features Improved SQL Breakdown This agent release adds the ability to see the breakdown of time spent in SQL statements such as CREATE, DROP, ALTER, SET, CALL, EXEC, EXECUTE, COMMIT and ROLLBACK. Execution of stored procedures through the callproc() or CALL statements will provide further breakdown based on the name of the stored procedure. Elasticsearch Support Instrumentation support for the official Elasticsearch client module and the separate pyelasticsearch module have been added. Time spent in calls made to Elasticsearch will be listed in both the main overview chart, as well as in the Databases tab in the UI. Previously, calls to Elasticsearch would have been shown as time spent in external web service calls. Features Changed Remove code snippets in stack traces Stack traces captured for errors and slow SQL queries will no longer include code snippets. This change is to prevent the possibility of capturing sensitive data embedded within the code. It reduces the overhead in capturing stack trace information, and also avoids a potential problem caused when the code on disk has changed in the time since the process was started. Bugs Fixed Ensure that messages sent to the data collector containing parts which were already compressed and encoded, were not being compressed a second time at the HTTP request level causing additional overhead. Guard against a potential agent error where an invalid URL was being passed to an instrumented external web service client. Motor (an asynchronous MongoDB library) incorrectly returns a non string object when the agent tries to access the __name__ attribute on Motor objects. This caused the agent to fail when calculating the name for an object, since we rely on this value being a string as specified by the Python object model definition. The agent now overrides the incorrect behavior of Motor to ensure that we can still generate names of objects correctly. When using Python 3 and audit logging was enabled, if messages being sent to our data collector were large enough that they were being compressed at the HTTP request level, the audit logging code would fail due to a bytes/Unicode mismatch. Instrumentation for the decr() method of umemcache client for Memcached was incorrectly calling the stats() method.",

For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see Status of the Python agent . Bugs Fixed Improved management of the network connection to our service When the agent registered itself with our data collector, it wasn't closing the socket connection immediately and instead it was holding it open for up to a minute when the first batch of data would be reported. If the socket connection was being closed remotely during that time, a BadStatusLine exception would be seen in the logs when the attempt was made to upload data. When the agent received an internal restart request from our data collector as the result of a server side configuration change, the socket connection wasn't being closed explicitly. In the case of CPython it would still be cleaned up and closed immediately due to reference counting, but under PyPy when it was closed was dependent on when PyPy garbage collection occurred. This could mean that the socket descriptor could stay in use for a while. Compatibility modules for transitioning from Python 2 to Python 3 When compatibility modules for Python 2/3 migration such as pies2overrides and future were installed in a Python 2 installation, they were installing modules which mimic modules which would normally only ever exist in a Python 3 installation. The presence of these modules were confusing the agent's instrumentation mechanisms. The result of this was that use of http.client from Python 3 in a Python 2 application would fail. Failures when making calls to external web services If a HTTP client module was supplied None as the value for the URL being requested, this would cause an exception when the agent was recording the data for that transaction. Use of the ExternalTrace context manager class directly, for recording external web services calls, would fail if there was no active transaction. This could occur in the time before the agent has successfully been able to register with our data collector. Setting of response content length when using Django The Django middleware installed by the agent to perform insertion of RUM monitoring code into responses, would always set the Content-Length even if it was not previously set. This could cause issues where a frontend had been set up with an expectation that Content-Length headers would never exist.",

    "description": "Notes This release of the Python agent includes a major update to how we capture and represent metrics for both SQL databases and NoSQL datastores. Metrics for both types of products will now be displayed in a unified \"Databases\" tab in the APM UI, and these metrics will also be associated with the specific product being used. In addition, we have enabled support for having key transactions on other transactions, such as background tasks. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see Status of the Python agent . New Features Unified view for SQL database and NoSQL datastore products. The response time charts in the application overview page will now include NoSQL datastores such as Memcached, Redis and MongoDB and also the product name of existing SQL databases such as MySQL, Postgres, Oracle etc. We also introduced a new unified view  within the APM UI for visualizing time spent in queries made against SQL databases and NoSQL datastore products. For existing SQL databases, in addition to the existing breakdown of SQL statements and operations, the queries are now also associated with the database product being used. For NoSQL datastores such as Memcached, Redis and MongoDB, we have now added information about operations performed against those products, similar to what is being done for SQL databases. Because this introduces a notable change to how SQL database metrics are collected, it is important that you upgrade the Python agent version on all hosts. If you are unable to transition to the latest agent version on all hosts at the same time, you can still access old and new metric data for SQL databases, but the information will be split across two separate views. Key transactions for other transactions. In addition to being able to create key transactions for web transactions, it is now possible to create key transactions  for other transactions, such as background tasks executed by Celery. Key transactions enable the setting of a per transaction Apdex and alerts, as well as the ability to run X-Ray sessions , including transaction specific thread profiling. No SQL datastore instrumentation. To complement our new unified view for SQL database and NoSQL datastore products in the APM UI, we have upgraded our existing instrumentation for Redis and MongoDB. Previously, these only provided a function breakdown in transaction summaries and sample transaction traces, but now they will report into the unified view for database and datastore products under their respective product categories. Existing instrumentation for Memcached clients have similarly been updated, as well as new support for the pymemcache module being added.",

Bug Fixes Agent not recovering when errors occur during registration If the agent initially registered with our data collector successfully, but subsequently failed to upload agent setting information due to a transient backend or network issue, the agent was not recovering from the error properly. The consequence of this was that the agent would not completely start up and no data would be collected or reported by that process. The operation of the web application as a whole would not have been affected. This issue, which was introduced in version 2.36.0.30 of the agent, is now fixed. Agent not able to connect via some proxy servers The Python agent was not able to connect to our data collector to register when certain proxy server installations or configurations were being used. We have updated the version of the internal HTTP client library used to resolve the issue. Identification of Python web server being used The Python agent was incorrectly reporting the Python web server being used as Tornado when both the 'gunicorn' and 'tornado' Python modules were being imported, even if the Tornado web server module wasn't actually being used. This did not affect the operation of the agent but could lead to confusion when trying to debug deployment issues.",

For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see Status of the Python agent . New Features Cross Application Tracing for individual transactions Version 2.38.0.31 of the Python agent introduced aggregated transaction maps. In this release, we have built on that feature to add the ability to view an end-to-end visualization of an individual transaction, in order to better understand what backend applications and external services were called during the course of a single transaction. Features Changed Synthetic support enabled by default When the Python agent added support for the collection of transaction traces for synthetics requests  in version 2.32.0.28, the feature had to be explicitly enabled in the agent configuration file. With this release, support for synthetics is enabled by default. Bug Fixes Non ASCII characters in transaction names If a transaction name contained a Unicode character outside of the ASCII range, the generation of the cross application tracing attributes would result in a UnicodeEncodeError. This bug affected versions 2.38.0.31 through 2.38.2.33. The issue is fixed in the current release. Parsing SQL statements referencing the database schema Previously, SQL statements that referenced a table from a database schema namespace, such as “schema.table_name”, would not always be parsed correctly, resulting in the table being identified as just “schema”. The agent now handles this case correctly, and the table is reported as “schema.table_name”. Additional support for Tornado 1.X If Tornado 1.X was being used, the instrumentation would fail at run time causing all web requests to fail. Monitoring of Tornado 1.X applications should now work correctly.",

New Features Cross Application Tracing The Cross Application Tracing feature is now enhanced with the aggregate transaction map  visualizations. This new visualization will help users spot bottlenecks in external services and give them an end-to-end understanding of what other applications and services are called within a transaction. All agents involved in the cross application communication must be upgraded to see the complete graph. Improvements Tornado 3.x Instrumentation The newly refactored Tornado instrumentation is turned on by default. This was introduced in the python agent version 2.32.0.28 under an optional feature flag. This change improves upon the stability of our Tornado instrumentation and accounts for the incremental changes introduced to the Tornado 3.x source tree. It also provides a more granular view of where the time is spent in a WebTransaction, by distinguishing the time spent doing work vs time spent waiting on a asynchronous call. Please be advised that we currently do not have instrumentation for Tornado 4.x, but we are working to add support for it. Capacity Analysis for mod_wsgi The capacity analysis  report shows how many instances of your web application is running and how busy they are. For a web application, the measure of how busy the application is, is calculated by looking at how much of the time the total available set of request handler threads are busy. For the case of using Apache/mod_wsgi in daemon mode, the measure of how busy your application is, has been getting over reported due to the nature of how threads are managed by mod_wsgi. If you are using mod_wsgi version 4.1.0 or higher, this measure will now be more accurately reported as it will use information provided by mod_wsgi about the total number of request handler threads which are available, rather than trying to calculate it based on what threads have been seen to be handling requests. Bug Fixes In version 2.28.0.26 and 2.32.0.28 of the agent, we added new features to track template includes and inclusion tags when using the Django template rendering system. We have had a few reports that indicate that for some users, but not everyone, that the instrumentation implementing these features may be causing an ongoing growth in memory usage for the web application processes over time. Right now, we don't understand the root cause for why this might be occurring in some instances, so to be on the safe side we have disabled these two features while we investigate further. The consequence of these features being disabled is that the web transaction performance breakdown and sample transaction traces will no longer show as a separate metric or entry where one template has been included in another. Further, if the tracking of special inclusion tags had been configured, they will also no longer be shown. We anticipate re-enabling the features once we have worked out what is occurring and made changes to ensure it does not occur again.",

This value remains unchanged from previous agents. Physical Cores : The total number of physical CPU cores available, counting hyper-threaded siblings as a single core.

Notes This release of the Python agent provides a preview of a significant overhaul of our instrumentation for Tornado version 3.2 and earlier. Further improvements to our Django instrumentation are also included, allowing time spent in rendering Django sub templates to be viewed separately. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute  via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent see Status of the Python agent . New Features Breakout of Django template rendering Previously when using Django templates, if the Django include  tag was being used, the time spent rendering that sub template was shown under the generic Template/Render category. When the include tag is now used, a distinct metric is instead created corresponding to the rendering time for that sub template. This will appear in the transaction performance breakdown and also in sample transaction traces. In the case of sample transaction traces, as the name of the template will be included in the metric name, it now also provides additional context for understanding where any time is being spent when rendering that template. Features Changed Preview of improved Tornado instrumentation Our instrumentation for Tornado version 3.2 and earlier has been experiencing a number of issues which could result in recording of data stopping and in some cases cause runtime exceptions which would affect the outcome of the executing web request. Upon investigation we found this has come about due to incremental changes in the internals of Tornado which were performed after we originally implemented the instrumentation for Tornado and which we didn't pick up as having being made. The Tornado developers have also recently released version 4.0 of Tornado. This version of Tornado has much more significant internal changes that result in our instrumentation failing completely. Before we could embark on trying to support version 4.0 of Tornado, we deemed it necessary to completely overhaul our existing instrumentation for older versions first in order to gives us good foundation on which to then implement support for version 4.0 of Tornado. This release of the agent provides a preview of the improved instrumentation for older versions of Tornado prior to version 4.0. The new instrumentation is not enabled by default and you will need to explicitly enable it. We have provided it as an opt in change at this point to allow you to properly test with the update first and provide us with any feedback on it and any remaining issues you may find. To enable the preview of the new Tornado instrumentation, you will need to add to the [newrelic]section of the agent configuration file the setting: If you are running on Heroku and are not using an agent configuration file, you can instead set the NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG environment variable. You can do this by running the Heroku command: Bug Fixes When an exception was raised by a WSGI application during the yielding of response content via a generator, the recording of that web request by the agent may not be closed off properly. This would result in no further web requests handled by that thread being recorded and reported. If this occurred for all request handler threads, then no data would then be reported for the whole web process. This issue relates to behaviour of the Python garbage collector and when Python objects are destroyed. At this point in time we believe this only affects users of pypy and does not affect users of CPython as the reference counting model of CPython usually gives more deterministic behaviour around when Python objects are destroyed. We don't however rule out that it could affect CPython and may explain a situation matching this problem we have seen in a couple of cases where users were using uWSGI. When attempting to use Tornado as a worker for gunicorn, an exception could occur on startup which would result in gunicorn failing immediately and exiting. In order to use this combination it was previously necessary to disable the gunicorn specific instrumentation related to WSGI applications by adding to your agent configuration file: If you were using the Tornado worker with gunicorn and using this workaround, the underlying problem has now been addressed and you should be able to remove that section from your agent configuration file. The mechanism we used for applying function wrappers for instrumentation was not being performed in the most optimal way for methods of classes. This could result in problems, including unexpected runtime exceptions, especially when trying to apply instrumentation to class methods, or methods of an existing instance of a type.",

New Features Improved instrumentation for Flask The Python agent now provides better web transaction naming and performance breakdown metrics when Flask style middleware are being used. This means that time spent in Flask @before_request and @after_request functions will now be broken out as their own metrics. If a @before_request function actually returns a response, the web transaction will be correctly named after that function rather than the Flask WSGI application entry point.

Notes This release of the Python agent improves data collection with the Django web framework.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute  via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent see Status of the Python agent . New Features Improved Django REST Framework naming Previously, when using the Django REST framework, web transactions were being named after the class based view that implemented the Django REST framework resources. Now, where such a view provides custom handler methods for different HTTP request method types or actions, the web transaction will be named after that custom handler method rather than the class as a whole. A new function breakdown metric will also be added for the custom handler method. This change will allow web requests using different HTTP request method types to be viewed separately. Django inclusion tag monitoring Usage of inclusion tags  in Django templates can now be monitored and will appear in the transaction breakdown table, charts and sample transaction traces. Due to the possibility that a large range of custom inclusion tags might be used and that they may be invoked a large number of times in tight loops, tracking of all inclusion tags may not be practical or may not produce worthwhile results in the transaction breakdown or sample transaction traces. As a result, monitoring of inclusion tags is off by default, with the preferred approach being that specific inclusion tags of interest be individually enabled through the agent configuration file. To enable monitoring of specific inclusion tags, a new section called import-hook:django should be added to the agent configuration: The instrumentation.templates.inclusion_tag setting within that section should then be set to a space separated list of the names of the inclusion tags to monitor. If there is any confusion over the identity of the inclusion tag, the full name of the inclusion tag function, with module name, can instead be listed. For example, data_hierarchy can also be identified using django.contrib.admin.templatetags.admin_list:date_hierarchy. In addition to specifying the names of the specific inclusion tags, it is also possible to specify * for instrumentation.templates.inclusion_tag in order to have usage of all inclusion tags be monitored: Enabling monitoring of all inclusion tags in this way is only recommended in development or test environments so as to get an initial idea of what inclusion tags are worth tracking. Once identified, the specific inclusion tags of interest should thereafter be listed individually in a production environment. Better monitoring of Django management commands Previously, the Python agent required you to manually set up the instrumentation for each specific Django management command in the agent configuration file. We have now made that easier by integrating the functionality as part of the agent itself. Due to the limitations on what Django management commands can be monitored, you will still need to list explicitly the commands you want monitored, but it can now be done in a single location as a space separated list under the setting instrumentation.scripts.django_admin of the import-hook:django section: By default, we automatically specify the startup timeout to be 10.0 seconds when monitoring the Django management commands. If you need to override the startup timeout, you can set the instrumentation.background_task.startup_timeout setting within the same import-hook:django configuration section.",

    "description": "The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see Update the agent . For more information, see End-of-life policy . Notes This release of the Python agent includes improvements to browser monitoring , with the primary change being that the Python agent is now able to perform automatic browser monitoring for a wider range of Python web frameworks running on a traditional WSGI server. This includes popular web frameworks such as Flask, Pyramid and Bottle. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New Features Prior to this version, automatic browser monitoring for HTML pages served up by a Python web application was only available if using the Django web framework. With this release this capability has now been expanded in most cases to cover any Python web framework being hosted on top of a web server with a direct interface for hosting Python WSGI applications. WSGI servers this covers include the popular Python web hosting packages Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI. Support does however not currently extend to Python web hosting mechanisms which provide a bridge to a WSGI application from a native Python web application API, such as is the case if using the Tornado or Twisted WSGI containers. What the change means is that if using a previously unsupported web framework such as Flask, Pyramid or Bottle, and you were not manually instrumenting your HTML page responses to make use of browser monitoring, you will now start to see automatically end user performance metrics being captured and displayed in the New Relic APM UI. You will also have access to the optionally enabled browser monitoring agent, enabling access to details of AJAX calls made by your pages and also the details of any client side Javascript errors which might have been raised. If you were previously manually instrumenting your HTML page responses to enable browser monitoring, you should in most cases now be able to discontinue such manual instrumentation. Note that at this time, in addition to lack of support for Tornado and Twisted WSGI containers, we do still have a few restrictions in place which mean we may not always be able to enable automatic browser monitoring support. The key restriction is that when using a web framework, the automatic support for browser monitoring will be disabled if you are using a middleware or plugin for the framework, which performs compression of responses, or which otherwise modifies the content encoding for the response. For example, automatic browser monitoring will still not be available if using the flask.ext.compress plugin with Flask, or the paste.gzipper middleware with any WSGI application. We are working on extending coverage to cases where such middleware or plugins are being employed, but if you are using them, for now you will still need to resort to manually instrumenting your responses to enable browser monitoring. The only exception to this is the Django web framework, where we already previously had support for automatic browser monitoring even if the Django GZipMiddleware was being used. For further details on the updated browser monitoring support and manually instrumenting your HTML page responses, see our documentation on page load timing when using the Python agent . If browser monitoring support is not currently enabled for your application or you need to disable it, then see our documentation on browser settings . Bug fixes/Improvements The agent was in some cases incorrectly inserting our instrumentation to HTML page responses which were marked as an attachment by way of a Content-Disposition HTTP response header or HTML page meta tag.",

Notes This release of the Python agent includes fixes related to tracking of external web service calls and minor improvements to automatic real user monitoring HTML insertion for Django. An offline developer mode has also be added to verify the operation of the agent with your application in a development or test environment. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New Features An offline developer mode for the agent now exists to allow for verification that the operation of the agent will not affect the monitored web application in a development or test environment, without sending any actual data to New Relic. As it is an offline mode, no additional hosts will be recorded against your New Relic account for billing purposes. The offline mode does not allow for any viewing of collected metric information and other data for the purposes of monitoring your application, so it is not a solution for running New Relic locally. Being able to run it however, will allow you determine if a newer version of the agent, or an upgrade of any third party package in conjunction with the agent, will still function correctly before you jump to upgrading the packages in your production environment. The offline developer mode can be enabled by setting the developer_mode setting in the agent configuration file, or the NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE environment variable, to true. Audit logging can also be enabled in conjunction with the offline developer mode so as to allow for the investigation of what data would be set to New Relic, resulting from the monitoring of your application, without actually sending any data to New Relic. Audit logging itself can be enabled by setting the the audit_log_file setting in the agent configuration file, or the NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG environment variable. It is not recommended that audit logging be enabled for any extended period as the resulting log file will be quite large. Bug fixes/Improvements When using the Bottle web framework, the setting error_collector.ignore_status_codes, for ignoring exceptions linked to specific HTTP response status codes, was being ignored in the case of using Bottle plugins and a plugin raised a HTTPError exception. This only affected Bottle versions 0.11 or higher. The New Relic feature for cross application tracing  between two monitored web applications was not working when a Python web application was using recent versions of the urllib3 and requests modules for initiating the call to the backend web application service. This affected version 1.8 or higher of urllib3 and version 2.3.0 of the requests module. External web service calls were not being monitored when using the prepared requests  feature of the requests module directly. When using the urllib or urllib2 modules, if a URI of the form file://..., corresponding to a local file on the file system, was passed to any function monitored by our instrumentation, a metric and transaction trace node were being generated corresponding to an external web service with host name of 'unknown'. The instrumentation now correctly filters out URIs which do not correspond to an actual remote web service. The automatic means for inserting page load timing  tracking code for real user monitoring (RUM) into HTML page responses returned from a Django application now works no matter the case used for HTML elements. Previously automatic insertion would only be performed where HTML elements were lower case. RUM tracking code inserted automatically into HTML page responses from Django is now more optimally placed when a X-UA-Compatible meta tag appeared in the head element of the HTML page. Previously the RUM code was placed at the end of the head element when such a meta tag existed. This would have meant that page loading times would not have accurately reflected time spent in loading assets from any script elements appear after the meta tag. The RUM code is now placed immediately after the meta tag. Placement is not done before the meta tag as some browsers require that the meta tag appear prior to any script elements. RUM tracking code inserted automatucally into HTML page responses from Django is now placed after any Content-Type meta tag which also contains a charset attribute. This is necessary as some browsers will not recognise such a meta tag if it does not occur early in the page content. If a script tag was therefore placed before this meta tag it could have resulted in the meta tag being pushed down sufficiently far enough in the page content so as not to be recognised.

    "description": "The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see Update the agent . For more information, see End-of-life policy . Notes This release of the Python agent introduces a means to enforce High-security mode from the agent configuration, as well as enabling capture of Insights events for background tasks. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New Features: Insights events are now also recorded for background tasks, in addition to the existing events already captured for web transactions. The application to record an exception against can now be explicitly provided using the keyword argument application when calling newrelic.agent.record_exception(). This enables the ability to record exceptions outside of the context of a monitored web transaction or background task. A suitable application object can be retrieved using newrelic.agent.application(). Features Changed: Enforcing High-security mode from the agent configuration is now supported. High-security mode is a feature to prevent any sensitive data from being sent to New Relic. The local setting for the agent must match the server setting in the New Relic APM UI. If there is a mismatch, the agent will log a message and act as if it is disabled. A link to the docs for High-security mode can be found here Attributes of high-security mode (when enabled): Requires an SSL connection to be used. Prevents capture of request parameters. Suppresses capture of custom parameters. The default setting for High-security mode is false. If you already have high-security mode enabled within the New Relic APM UI, you will need to add: to your local agent configuration file. Or if using Heroku, set the NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY environment variable by running: When using the gunicorn WSGI server, the request URL which appears in transaction trace samples and error details will now be sourced from the RAW_URI variable passed by gunicorn in the WSGI environ dictionary. This will ensure that what is displayed is the raw URL before % escape sequences have been decoded. This avoids the problem of the URL being shown as a raw byte sequence. When audit logging is enabled, the responses returned from our data collector service will now also be logged. Bug fixes/Improvements: An incorrect module name was being derived for methods of classes, when used in web transaction and function trace naming, where the method was from a base class defined in a different module, but invoked via a derived class. When using Django class based views, if a class based view was used explicitly from within a view handler, the name of the class based view method was overriding the web transaction name, which at that point would have been set to the view handler. The class based view method name will now only be used for the web transaction name when it is actually registered as the view handler. Explain plans for SQL queries were not working when the SQL database cursor had been configured to return a dictionary rather than a tuple for each row set when the original query was made.",

Notes This release of the Python agent is an incremental release and includes minor feature changes and enhancements. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directory from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New Features: Use of HTTP proxies over SSL using the HTTP CONNECT tunnelling mechanism is now supported. Set the 'proxy_scheme' to 'http' to invoke this mode. This will become the default in a future version of the agent. If migrating from an older agent version and need to keep the existing behaviour going forward, set 'proxy_scheme' to 'https'. Alternatively, ensure you provide the scheme in the form of a URI as part of the 'proxy_host' setting. Added request queueing support to the instrumentation for the Tornado ASYNC framework. Request queueing times should start showing in the APM Overview page when a frontend web server such as Nginx, has been configured to add the appropriate headers. For more details see our documentation on setting up tracking of queueing time . The 'newrelic.agent.record_exception()' can now be called without actually passing it any exception details. In this case, the details of any current exception being handled will be used instead. Added a new mechanism for automatic discovery of third party instrumentation modules as an alternative to having to list them explicitly in the agent configuration file. Any such instrumentation module should register entry points under the 'newrelic.hooks' group in 'setup.py' for that package. The entries should be of the form 'target-module = instrumentation-module:function'. When the 'target-module' is imported, the function 'instrumentation-module:function' will be executed and passed the module. Any instrumentation module should then use functions provided by our agent API under 'newrelic.agent' to instrument the module as necessary. Bug fixes/Improvements: When using the CherryPy web framework, the NotFound, InternalRedirect and HTTPRedirect exceptions if raised are now ignored and not treated as errors. When using the Pyramid web framework, if a view could not be found to handle a request, it could cause the agents' Pyramid instrumentation to fail, causing an exception. When using the Pyramid web framework, the PredicateMismatch exception if raised when trying to resolve a URL to a view handler is now ignored and not treated as an error. Updated the instrumentation for the pywapi module to drop support for the now discontinued Google weather API. Overhauled the mechanisms used to wrap instrumentation around functions to be monitored. When the agent is installed, if the optional C extension module can be compiled and installed, then the new wrappers should have a reduced overhead compared to the pure Python versions of the wrappers otherwise used. Running thread profiles on coroutine (gevent/eventlet) based systems no longer cause a timeout in the UI. Although the UI now no longer times out, as explained in our status of the Python agent  documentation, we still however do not generate any results when running thread profiling on coroutine based systems.",

Added support for accepting additional arguments to the execute() method of database cursors implemented by the oursql and cx_Oracle modules which are not covered by the Python DBAPI 2 (PEP 249) specification. The time taken for connect() calls of database client modules will now be counted in Database  time (on the APM Overview page). The automatic rollback or commit performed on exit of the context manager for a database connection was not being monitored and reported when using the psycopg2, psycopg2cffi and postgresql database client modules for the PostgreSQL database. Improved how database connections are managed when performing explain plans and also applied caps to the number of process wide explain plans that are done in each reporting period. This should have the result of reducing overhead in situations where there was a large number of candidate SQL statements on which to perform explain plans. Any additional overhead from the agent in the past would have been most notable when performing an X-Ray session against a key transaction.",

For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New Features Record Deployments : A new 'record-deploy' sub command has been added to the 'newrelic-admin' script installed with the Python agent. This is a wrapper around the HTTP API provided by New Relic for recording deployments  against your application. To use the sub command, add your API-KEY in the agent configuration file under the 'api_key' setting. The path to the config file, description for the deploy and optional revision, change log and user information can then be supplied as arguments to the sub command. Audit Logging : An improved audit logging feature has been added to the agent for capturing details of what is being sent up to our data collectors. Information is now captured into a separate log file in a more human-readable format to aid any review process carried out to determine what the agent is sending. The audit logging feature can be enabled by setting the the 'audit_log_file' setting in the agent configuration file, or the 'NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG' environment variable. It is not recommended that audit logging be enabled for any extended period as the resulting log file will be quite large. Bug fixes/Improvements: The agent now ensures that the certificate bundle packaged with the agent is always used when certifying SSL connections back to our data collector.

For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New Features: Instrumentation added for the Cornice REST component library for the Pyramid web framework. Bug fixes/Improvements: Enhance the instrumentation for the Bottle web framework to work around the problem that the Bottle framework was not using 'functools.wraps()' correctly in the implementation of its 'auth_basic()' decorator. This was resulting in the web transaction being named after the 'wrapper' function closure used in the implementation of the decorator rather than the wrapped request handler the decorator was applied to. A pull request was made against the Bottle framework and the change will be included in a future version of Bottle. Our change ensures that the correct result is also obtained with older Bottle versions. When using the database connection object created by the sqlite3 database client module as a context manager, the automatic rollback or commit performed by the context manager when the scope of the context manager is exited, will now be tracked. If a function trace was applied to the bound method of a class implemented in a C extension module, the name of the module shown in the name of the function was being wrongly designated as the Python 'builtins' module. Updated memcache instrumentation wrappers to use our latest function wrapper implementation. Our latest function wrappers better preserve the ability to introspect wrapped functions/methods and so return the same result as one would expect if no wrapper had been applied.",

This means that if you are not using a web framework we already support and instrument, are using a WSGI component library, or implementing your WSGI application from scratch, it is no longer necessary to wrap the WSGI application entry point with our special decorator or wrappers when using the gevent WSGI servers. Features Changed: Previously it was only possible to list multiple applications in New Relic to report data to via the 'app_name' setting in the agent configuration file. Attempting to list multiple application names (separated by the requisite semi colon), in the 'NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME' environment variable was ignored with the complete value (including semi colons), being used as the application name. This limitation has now been lifted and a list of applications to report to can now be specified using the 'NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME' environment variable. Bug fixes/Improvements: The instrumentation for the Bottle web framework has been improved. The changes include the request handler now being broken out properly as a separate item in the transaction breakdown, the web transaction being named after an error handler when appropriate and requests which could not be mapped to a request handler being named as being a 404 if no error handler was provided. Handling of exceptions for HTTP errors has also been improved and are now being correctly matched against our internal list of HTTP status codes to be ignored as exceptions. Previously the instrumentation was too liberally ignoring all HTTP error exceptions. When using the Flask web framework, a NotFound exception raised within the underlying Werkzeug library was not being ignored. It is now no longer necessary to explicitly ignore the exception type 'werkzeug.exceptions:NotFound' in the agent configuration. When an unhanded exception was raised by a Pylons application, a bug in the implementation of the agent's error trace wrappers would cause a subsequent exception to be raised from the agent itself, masking the details of the original exception. When trying to determine how much memory was available on a system, the agent would fallback to trying to the use the 'psutil' module, if installed, if our standard ways of checking failed. This would cause the agent to fail on a PaaS such as PythonAnyWhere, which prohibits access to the /proc filesystem. Use of 'psutil' as a fallback has now been removed to avoid any potential for a failure. The version of the bundled 'requests' module the agent used to perform HTTP requests to our data collector did not work with Python 2.6.2 or older. A fix to 'urllib3' used by the 'requests' module has been back ported to address the issue. Our updated database instrumentation wrappers released in the last agent version, would incorrectly return that a database connection or cursor object were callable. This could confuse code which was trying to introspect those objects to perform traversal in order to get access to inner details of the implementation of the database modules.",

Notes This release of the Python agent includes various improvements and bug fixes related to instrumentation for database client modules, as well as a notable fix to our 'newrelic-admin' script affecting some users who referenced Python virtual environments via a symbolic link. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New Features: Instrumentation of the WSGI application entry point will now add a new breakdown metric to web transactions corresponding to the finalization of the WSGI request. Within the workings of the interaction between the WSGI server and the WSGI application, this is the point at which the WSGI server will call any close() method on the iterable returned by the WSGI application. The name of this new breakdown metric is 'WSGI/Finalize'. In the case where there was actually a 'close()' method, a further breakdown metric will also appear corresponding to that method. Added support to instrumentation for MySQL and PostgreSQL database client modules for monitoring database queries when the database connection object is used as a context manager. Such context manager features are outside of the scope of the Python DBAPI2 (PEP 249)  specification, not all database client modules support it and nor do they all work the same. Although supported, we would suggest consideration should be given to not using these context manager features if you need your code to be portable between databases. Added support to instrumentation for MySQL database client modules for monitoring database queries when the database connection object was created using the Connect() function. The Connect() function falls outside of the scope of the Python DBAPI2 (PEP 249)  specification. Although supported, we would suggest consideration should be given to not using this Connect() function if you need your code to be portable between databases. Added database instrumentation support for the mysql-connector-python  database client module. Custom parameters for a transaction which are a string or numeric value will now be added to and reported with analytic events reported to our analytics system code named Rubicon . This can be disabled using the agent configuration setting 'analytics_events.capture_attributes'. The capture of custom parameters against a transaction trace can now be disabled using the agent configuration setting 'transaction_tracer.capture_attributes'. The capture of custom parameters against error details can now be disabled using the agent configuration setting 'error_collector.capture_attributes'. Features Changed: The agent API function add_user_attribute() is now deprecated and functionality merged with the add_custom_parameter() function. The latter function should now be used instead. The display of such parameters in browser traces is now optionally enabled with the agent configuration setting 'browser_monitoring.capture_attributes'. Bug fixes/Improvements: If the 'newrelic' package was installed into a Python virtual environment, but the 'newrelic-admin' script was executed via a path that traversed a symlink to the virtual environment, the protections within the agent bootstrapping procedure was detecting that the agent was trying to be used with an application running against a different virtual environment when it was actually the same. This would result in the application not being monitored. This issue was introduced in version 2.8.0 of the agent when additional protections were added against mixing application/modules from different Python virtual environments. Explain plans were not being performed on SQL queries made via the executemany() method of a database cursor object. When explain plans are now done, the data inputs from the first row of input data for the executemany() call will be used. When using Python 2, if strings were supplied for the web transaction name, custom parameters, in error details etc, and that string contained a series of characters which could not be decoded as valid UTF-8, then an exception would occur. In the case of a web transaction name, this could result in the exception affecting the current web transaction and result in an error response being sent back to a user. For the case of a transaction trace or error details, the exception would prevent the sending of the captured data up to our data collector and it would be discarded. This was a regression within the agent behaviour introduced when Python 3 support was added to the agent. Fixed instrumentation for sqlite database modules which could result in instrumentation not being applied correctly, and so no database metrics coll…",

Notes This release of the Python agent is a major new version and primarily focuses on the addition of support for Python 3. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directory from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New Features: Python 3.3 or later is now supported. This includes support for popular web frameworks that have been ported to Python 3, such as CherryPy, Django, Flask, Pyramid and Tornado. Added new instrumentation to track as external service calls, requests made by the 'thrift' client module. Added new instrumentation to track memcache calls made by the 'bmemcached' client module. Features Removed: Python 2.5 is no longer supported. The minimum required Python version is now 2.6. If using Python 2.5, you should ensure that any requirement for the 'newrelic' module listed in a 'setup.py' or pip requirements file says 'newrelic<2.0.0.0'. Bug fixes/Improvements: Fixed broken instrumentation for 'httplib' module, which would cause an exception where the 'httplib' connect() method was being invoked via the Connection class type rather than an instance of the Connection class. Fixed issue where if the host system clock was wound backwards, then the response time of active requests could be set as being zero, resulting in a ZeroDivisionError when calculating thread utilization. Fixed issue where the use of SSL via a HTTP proxy by the agent to connect to the New Relic data collector to report data would fail. Fixed broken instrumentation for sqlite database client module which resulted in the executescript() API call failing. Add workaround for uWSGI issue where when using gevent mode of uWSGI, it would attempt to wait on all greenlets on process shutdown, instead of only on non daemon threads, specifically the request threads. The issue was causing processes to hang for 60 seconds on shutdown before the uWSGI master process killed the process. We are in discussion with uWSGI authors about a permanent fix to uWSGI.",

Notes: This release of the Python agent addresses an issue with under reporting of memory use on Linux, as well as other minor bug fixes and enhancements. For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New features: Added support for automatically wrapping the WSGI application entry point when using the Paste HTTP server. Custom metrics can now be reported via the public agent API by supplying an appropriate application object as an additional argument to 'newrelic.agent.record_custom_metric()'. Added support for the 'psycopg2ct' database client module for PostgreSQL. When needing to communicate via a firewall, the proxy settings can now be set via environment variables in addition to being able to be set in the agent configuration file. The number of CPU cores is now being reported in the agent environment and displayed in the UI. A warning will now be logged in the agent log file if an older version of uWSGI is being used which has bugs with its conformance to the WSGI specification. Such older uWSGI versions would see incorrect data being reported due to the bug in uWSGI. A warning will now be logged in the agent log file if uWSGI is being used and the 'enable-threads' option is not being supplied to uWSGI to enable threading within the Python interpreter, a feature which is a mandatory requirement for the Python agent to be able to work. A range of additional logging and debugging options have been added to allow our support team to better help you when you are having issues with setting up the agent. Bug fixes/Improvements: Addressed problem where memory usage was being under reported on Linux systems. The degree to which memory usage was under reported was dependent on the memory page size the system was using. If affected you can expect to see memory usage being reported jump up as it reports the correct value. If the local Python installation is already using a 'sitecustomize.py' file, the agent's own 'sitecustomize.py' file will ensure that the existing copy is imported and code in it executed so that existing definitions are still applied. Installation of the agent could fail under buildout due to a missing Python future import for the Python with statement under Python 2.5. Made parsing of URLs more tolerant to malformed URLs in web external calls. The agent was encountering an error when the port number of a URL was not an integer, resulting in the data for that transaction being discarded. Use of raw greenlets from within a transaction was failing causing an exception and the users web request to typically fail with a HTTP 500 error response. Configuration of the agent will no longer fail on startup if there is no 'newrelic' section in the configuration file.",

A profiling session can be initiated for a period from 2 to 10 minutes. The profiler will periodically sample what all the executing threads are doing, aggregating the results together to get a statistical snapshot of where in your application most time is being spent. Bug fixes/Improvements: Importing of the greenlet module was resulting in the capacity analysis report metrics being disabled, even though it was meant to only be disabled when specifically using a coroutine based WSGI server such as gevent and eventlet mode of gunicorn. Improvements to the instrumentation wrapper applied to the Django view handler function so that code which tries to compare the view handler to an expected value should work. Note that this is dependent upon using an equality test rather than an identity test. Reverted prior change which stripped the instrumentation wrapper from the Django view handler when it was passed to any Django view middleware. Improvements to the instrumentation wrapper should remove the need to do this. Having the view handler passed in with the wrapper applied is required to ensure that calls to the view handler are tracked properly where the view handler is called from within the view middleware. Although not strictly required due to improvements to the instrumentation wrapper applied to a Django view handler, strip the wrapper when a view handler is passed into django.core.urlresolvers.reverse() function to ensure it can correctly determine the URL mapping to the view handler. Disable automatic RUM header/footer insertion when using Django 1.5 and the new streaming HTTP response object is returned. This is being disabled so that the response is not buffered, thereby interfering with the streaming process. If streaming a HTML response and RUM reporting is still required, the RUM header and footer will need to be added manually .

The environment variable 'NEW_RELIC_SSL' can now be set to enable use of a SSL connection when reporting data to our data collector. Enabling values are 'true', 'on' or '1'. This can be used on platforms such as Heroku where configuration is performed using environment variables instead of an agent configuration file. Added instrumentation for tracking database queries when using the 'pymysql' module for the MySQL database. Bug fixes/Improvements: Fix to algorithm calculating name of function for case where function was wrapped with a decorator implemented using a class. Previously was using the name of the decorator class rather than the name of the wrapped function.

Notes: This release of the Python agent contains capacity analysis reporting, an improved sampling algorithm to ensure a wider sampling of slow transactions and added support for TastyPie, dropbox and facepy modules. For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New features: Enable capacity analysis reporting where web application is single threaded or multithreaded (but not coroutine based system such as gevent and eventlet). This report helps you determine if you have enough instances deployed to keep up with request load and so tune your configuration for optimal performance. Criteria by which slow transaction samples are captured has been changed so as to include slow transactions for a broader range of transactions. Previously the transaction with the slowest overall response time would always be captured and reported. Whether a specific transaction will be preserved as a sample of a slow transaction will now also depend on whether a recent slow transaction had already been captured for it and give preference to recording slow transactions for a different transaction, rather than the same transaction all the time, if it is always the slowest. Where TastyPie is being used with Django, instead of all web transactions being handled by TastyPie being labeled against the TastyPie wrapper, the web transactions will now be aggregated against the specific methods of the resource or API object handling the request. Added instrumentation for the 'dropbox' Python module to track time spent calling out to the DropBox web service. A call to this web service would have been tracked previously by virtue of the 'dropbox' module internally using the 'httplib' module. This added instrumentation however makes the data collected more accurate as will properly track time spent sending the request and receiving the response. It will also attribute the call to the 'dropbox' module in transaction traces and performance breakdown data. Added instrumentation for the 'facepy' Python module to track time spent calling out to the Facebook web service. A call to this web service would have been tracked previously by virtue of the 'facepy' module internally using the 'requests' module. This added instrumentation however allows the call to be attributed to the 'facepy' module in transaction traces and performance breakdown data. Added support for gevent < 0.13.7 by way of patching an existing bug in gevent. The specific problem in gevent was patched in version 0.13.7 of that package. This change will allow older versions of gevent to also be used if there is a requirement. Bug fixes/Improvements: Instrumentation for Genshi templates was failing when the OR operator was used inside of a template. If an exception occurred in the first call to read data from wsgi.input to get the request content, it would cause a subsequent exception when recording of response time was being finalised. This wasn't causing any impact on user requests, but would result in any metrics for that request being discarded and an error being logged in the agent log.",

    "description": "The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see Update the agent . For more information, see End-of-life policy . Notes: This release of the Python agent introduces a number of new features including improvements to RUM browser traces. Performance of the agent has also been improved though reducing some of the overheads when dealing with tracking SQL database queries. For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New features: The agent now collects additional application tier transaction trace samples for slow transactions and will correlate them with any corresponding RUM browser trace . Slow transaction traces will now show a figure corresponding to the amount of CPU burn that occurred during the period the transaction was running. This can be used to get an indication of whether code being executed was CPU intensive or principally waiting on I/O. Slow transaction traces for web requests will now provide an indication of how many concurrent requests were executing at the same time in the process the request was being handled. This can be used to determine how busy the process was at that time, but would also be used in conjunction with the recorded CPU burn to determine whether CPU burn was all from the one transaction or could also be due to parallel executing web requests in a multithreaded application. Note that this measure is dependent on an optional C extension component of the agent being able to be installed at the time of installation of the agent. Slow transaction traces for web requests will now display information about the amount of request content read and the amount of response content generated. This will include details about what methods of 'wsgi.input' were used to read content and how long it in total took to read the request content. Similar details are also provided about how response content was generated and how long it took from start to finish. Slow transaction traces for web requests will now display the value of any frontend queueing time within the server stack which pertained to that specific request. Note that this is dependent on the server stack having being configured to introduce the required header  to allow queueing time to be measured. The Python agent recognises the 'X-Queue-Start' header. Automatic support is now provided for tracking frontend queueing time within the server stack when an application is deployed to Heroku. An API call and means via the WSGI environ dictionary is now provided for indicating that a transaction should not be a candidate for slow transaction traces. This is to allow one to ignore transactions which are known to always be slow. The API call is 'newrelic.agent.suppress_transaction_trace()'. Calls to Django APIs for sending emails will now be tracked in the performance breakdown for transactions, as well as being displayed in slow transaction traces. Support for Celery 3.0. Bug fixes/Improvements: Overheads within the agent which could affect performance of the application have been reduced. The improvements specifically revolve around the processing of SQL database queries. This is principally to address larger than expected overheads seen by a very small subset of users which had large or more complicated SQL queries. The changes could though still result in a small general reduction in overhead and CPU usage directly attributable to the monitoring down by the agent when SQL database queries are being tracked. Where it is possible to build C extension components at the time the agent is installed, optional C speedups for JSON will now be installed. This reduces the overhead of JSON encoding when data is being sent by the agent to the New Relic data collector on each one minute harvest cycle. If the C extension cannot be compiled, the agent will fall back to using pure Python code as it has done in prior versions of the agent. Django instrumentation has been improved and issues addressed with the way that instrumentation wrappers were applied to view handlers. For example, when a view handler is passed to a view middleware, any instrumentation wrapper is now removed. This is because the wrapper could cause issues for some code which tried to do a direct comparison between the view handler passed and an expected value. It is believed this change will fix issues when using Mezzanine. A sporadic issue with the data collector rejecting uploaded data due to what it believes was malformed JSON should be addressed. This was due to some metric values being aggregated as integers rather than as float values. This resulted in overflow of 64 bit values in the data collector due to Python supporting arbitrary length integers and thus being able to send values larger than 64 bits. The agent will now no longer fail on import when -OO option is used with the Python interpreter to enable highest level of optimisation. This was an i…",

    "description": "The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see Update the agent . For more information, see End-of-life policy . Notes: This release of the Python agent has focused on improving the way the agent communicates with the New Relic core application. This includes improved logging and error handling, but also adds support for SSL and connecting via a proxy when the monitored host is located behind a firewall. For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . Changed features: The request method for a call to an external web service, when able to be collected by instrumentation, is now shown against a web external node in a slow transaction trace where as previously it showed the path segment of the URL. The URL, minus embedded user/password and query string is instead now shown as a label when hovering over the web external node in the slow transaction trace details. Improved logging and error handling when communicating with the New Relic core application. Many messages previously logged as errors will now be logged as warnings and an error only logged when a recurring problem is detected. This should reduce emails triggered from errors logged via the Python logging module to only those that may actually require action. Significant error messages or warnings will be output to standard output when running the agent test via the 'newrelic-admin validate-config' command. This ensures that it will be easier to detect when the test has failed due to network connectivity or license key issues. New features: Connecting to the New Relic core application using a secure SSL connection is now supported. This is enabled by setting the 'ssl' setting in the agent configuration file to 'true'. Connecting to the New Relic core application via a proxy is now supported. This is enabled by setting the 'proxy_host' and 'proxy_port' settings in the agent configuration file. If a secure SSL connection is desired, the 'ssl' setting can be set to 'true' at the same time. If the proxy requires a user name and password, the 'proxy_user' and 'proxy_pass' settings can be additionally set. When sending collected data to the New Relic core application it will be compressed when over a certain size to cut down on the amount of data being sent. The Python agent now includes its own self instrumentation and profiling capabilities to allow New Relic to monitor the performance of the agent itself and help debug any performance issues reported by a user which may occur in rare circumstances with certain web applications. Bug fixes: Where a user name and password were being included as part of a URL for a call to an external web service, eg., 'user:pass@localhost /', that the Python agent was instrumenting, the details were not always being scrubbed properly from details being reported to the New Relic core application.",

Bug fixes: Fix assertion violations when greenlets were used explicitly in the context of a normal thread based request handler. Installation of package using Python 2.5 was giving warnings when trying to byte code compile installed .py files due to missing import for 'with_statement' from __future__ module in some modules. The newrelic-admin script is now installed correctly when installing the package as an egg under buildout. The newrelic.agent.stop_recording() function was causing errors when using any WSGI hosting mechanism other than Apache/mod_wsgi and wasn't working as intended even under mod_wsgi.

    "description": "The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see Update the agent . For more information, see End-of-life policy . Bug fixes: Added full support for being able to use agent package with buildout. Previously the 'newrelic-admin' script was not installed correctly when buildout was being used to manage package installation. Added support for versions 2.2 and 2.5 of the distributed task queuing system Celery . Added support for older 'redis' client versions which did not separate commands into 'StrictRedis' and 'Redis' client objects. The database table name was not always extracted properly from SQL queries where sub selects were being used, especially when additional bracketing was being used for readability. Usually this was occuring where hand crafted SQL was being generated rather than being automatically generated through an ORM or DAL. Type handler registration in psycopg2 client module would fail due to agent instrumentation wrapper around connection and cursor objects. Javascript header added into response of type 'text/html' when Django being used and end user monitoring enabled, would be placed into wrong location of '' element if 'X-UA-Compatible' meta tag existed. This would cause issues for IE browser clients which meta tag related to. New features: Server side configuation is now available for the Python agent. This will be of most use for Heroku installations where there is by default no agent configuration file for defining local override settings. Distiguish time spent invoking the WSGI application for a request and the subsequent processing of any iterable returned by the WSGI application. These will show as nodes 'WSGI/Application' and 'WSGI/Response' in performance breakdowns and slow transaction traces. This mainly helps where iterable is a generator which performs work for each yielded item as provides proper context. Time spent in writing back a large reponse to a slow HTTP client will also be more visible. Distinguish separately the time spent in the top level WSGI application callable where the agent WSGI middleware wrapper is being applied. This will be the node which gets listed immediately under 'WSGI/Application' in a slow transaction trace. For Django, record separately time spent in processing certain types of form POSTs. This helps to show where being spent processing a large data upload. Show content length and content type details for a request in slow transaction and error details. Show content length for a response in slow transaction and error details. Features changed: Longer timeout when doing an agent test using the 'validate-config' command of the 'newrelic-admin' script. The short timeout was previously causing some users with slow DNS or networks to see the test as failing.",

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directory from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New features: Support for New Relic's Cross Application Tracing  feature is now available for the Python agent. This feature enables correlation of transaction traces between different services in your stack. It works on external calls made between applications monitored by any New Relic agents (Java, .NET, Ruby and Python), which support this feature. At this time the Python agent supports this feature on outgoing calls when using the 'httplib' module or any other module which uses 'httplib', such as the 'urllib', 'urllib2', 'urllib3' and 'requests' modules. Any inbound calls from other agents which support the feature will also be handled. Added instrumentation for the weberror  package. This provides visibility into potentially blocking operations such as sending of email for exceptions which are being reported. Added instrumentation for the umemcache  package. Added instrumentation for the DBAPI2 compliant interface for the IBM DB2 ibm_db_dbi  database client package. Bug fixes/Improvements: When running a WSGI application under the Tornado WSGI container, data reporting would stop if an unhandled exception managed to propagate back up to the Tornado WSGI container. This was due to a bug  in Tornado in respect of its compliance with the WSGI specification. A workaround is provided to avoid the problems this caused to the Python agent. Tornado versions prior to 3.2 will still carry that bug however and we make no attempt to address the bug in Tornado. The Tornado instrumentation was causing template rendering to fail where a relative path was used to refer to the template and no template path had been specified for the RequestHandler instance or globally. The Tornado instrumentation was causing exceptions when using the @tornado.gen decorators under Tornado 2.X. When using Django, web transactions will now be named after individual view handlers when using class based views, rather than being named after the class itself. When using Pyramid, web transactions will now be named after individual view handlers when using view classes, rather than being named after the class itself. Celery instrumentation had stopped working correctly for Celery versions 2.5.3 through 2.5.5. No data was being reported where a monitored process was being shutdown within a couple of seconds of being started even if the agent was able to register. This could result in custom metrics in particular not being reported. SSL certificate validation was failing on older Debian systems due to the OpenSSL libraries not being able to process a couple of the certificates bundled with the Python agent. Those certificates were not required and have been removed. Calculation of a time string was failing on Windows due to using a strftime() formatter which only existed on UNIX systems.",

Notes This release of the Python agent removes the experimental label from our Tornado Web and Pyramid support, with support now being enabled by default. The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directory from our download site . For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see Status of the Python agent . New features: The previously experimental support for the native Tornado Web API has been greatly expanded and is now enabled by default. This is in addition to the tornado.wsgi.WSGIContainer support we previously provided and includes the native Tornado Web API for constructing async applications. Running a limited subset of the native Tornado Web API within a separate WSGI server using the tornado.wsgi.WSGIApplication adapter is also now supported. The previously experimental support for the Pyramid web framework has been improved and is now enabled by default. When using a DBAPI2 compliant database client, calls to stored procedures via the callproc() method of the database cursor are now tracked. Previously, only calls made to stored procedures by explicitly using a CALL SQL statement were being tracked. All calls to stored procedures currently appear under the category of 'SQL - Other'. A future agent update is planned which will split out calls to stored procedures separately and report them on the databases tab. Added instrumentation for automatically wrapping the WSGI application when using the CherryPy WSGI server bundled with the CherryPy framework. Added instrumentation for automatically wrapping the WSGI application when using the WSGI server from the Python standard library wsgiref module. Be aware that due to non conformance with the WSGI specification, it is not recommended that the WSGI server from the wsgiref module be used unless using Python 2.7.4 or higher. Issues with older versions of the WSGI server in the wsgiref module will cause incorrect reporting of data. More details are provided in our status of the Python agent . Bug fixes/Improvements: External web calls made using the 'requests' module from a session were not being correctly monitored, resulting in such requests being picked up as being performed by the lower level 'httplib' module and the time taken not being inclusive of the whole request. The collection of explain plans by the agent in a background thread when performing a data harvest, was not explicitly performing a rollback. This could result in database proxies such as pgbouncer believing the database connection was now dirty and force closing the connection and ejecting it from the current database connection pool. The wrapper used by the agent around wsgi.input passed in the WSGI request environment was preventing non standard WSGI applications directly reaching down to the original socket connection so as to implement extensions such as websockets. The object wrapper used in our instrumentation for function traces has been improved so that it will pass type checks performed using builtin Python calls such as isinstance(), isfunction() and isclass(). This addresses issues where the object wrappers could interfere with the correct operation of web frameworks which derived the calling convention to be used when invoking a handler function from the type of the handler. Note that using type() on the wrapper object will still yield its true type, so functions such as isinstance() should always be used where possible. The agent could fail on startup when running on a system with a non English locale using a custom date/time format.",

    "description": "The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see Update the agent . For more information, see End-of-life policy . Notes This release of the Python agent introduces a major new feature called X-Ray Sessions. This feature allows you to gain deeper insights into a key transaction's performance by showing transaction traces alongside long-running profiler results. For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New features: X-Ray Sessions provide more targeted transaction trace samples and thread profiling for web transactions. For full details see our X-Ray sessions documentation . For new agent installations, the agent will now default to using a SSL connection when connecting to our data collector to report any data. If updating from an older agent version, you will however need to manually update your agent configuration file and change the 'ssl' setting to 'true' to always use SSL connections. When connecting direct to our data collector over a SSL connection, SSL certificate validation will now be performed to mitigate the possibility of man in the middle attacks. Breakdown metrics for transactions are now recorded as unscoped metrics as well as the existing metrics scoped to a web transaction. As custom dashboards can only chart unscoped metrics, what this means is that it is now possible to create custom dashboards that display data on specific breakdown metrics, such as time spent in traced functions. For example, you may wish to chart time spent in creating database connections, or specific middleware and view handler functions. When displaying error details, the full path of the exception is now displayed and not just the class name. This makes it easier to correctly identify the full name, with that name then being able to be directly copied into the 'error_collector.ignore_errors' setting of the agent configuration file if it is desired that that exception be ignored. Added the 'newrelic.agent.record_custom_metrics()' function to the public API for the agent to allow the recording of many custom metrics in one function call to the agent. XXXFeatures Changed: We have temporarily disabled the generation of CPU burn information for transaction traces. This was displaying inaccurate values after a UI change, but also had an underlying issue whereby it was reporting CPU burn by the whole process and not just the thread handling the request. We are withdrawing the feature until we can improve the accuracy of the reported value. We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server makes use of coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because the nature of how coroutines are implemented, means we were are not able to generate accurate usable data. Bug fixes/Improvements: When queueing Celery tasks from a web application, those web transactions were in some cases being wrongly categorised as background tasks. The name of the transaction was also being labelled with a string with the object representation, resulting in metric grouping issues. The older version of the 'requests' package we were bundling and were using for any HTTP calls was not closing socket descriptors immediately when a requests session object was disposed of. This could result in a small number of open socket descriptors being held open until the Python garbage collector kicked in and closed them. Login credentials supplied as part of a URL, could in some circumstances appear with the URL parameter associated with a web external node in a transaction trace sample. Django 1.5 moved which module the 'Http404' exception was declared in. As a result we were no longer correctly ignoring it when catching exceptions to process as errors. A check designed to warn against the use of uWSGI versions prior to 1.2.6, which contain a bug which results in the agent recording incorrect response times, was failing on very old uWSGI versions. Updated our gevent instrumentation to accommodate a prototype change in gevent 1.0rc1. Updated our bottle instrumentation to handle the non numeric version string used in bottle development versions. After five minutes of being unable to connect to our data collector to report data, the agent will now internally reset itself, discarding accumulated metric data and require the agent to reregister itself with our core application before collecting data once again. This is to ensure that we do not unnecessarily keep accruing data and causing an increase in memory usage while we cannot contact our data collector. Avoid the potential for a web request to deadlock in a situation where a web framework transaction management system made a copy of the object we use to record details about web transactions or background tasks.",

    "description": "The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see Update the agent . For more information, see End-of-life policy . Fixes: Addressed a performance issue which would cause high CPU load, when parsing SQL queries which had a large number of values for a SQL 'IN' clause. Agent version was not reported in form A.B.C.D in all cases. This was causing UI to warn that Python agent was out of date even when running version newer than the minimum recommended version. When 'feedparser' module is used, now correctly track external web service requests where URI used 'feed' or feed:http' for scheme. Illegal non ASCII characters in a URL could cause the agent to generate Unicode conversion warnings or outright fail a request with an exception where the character sequence could not be decoded to Unicode using the Python system default encoding. The table name for a SQL query was not being correctly derived when the SQL contained a select sub query or table name aliases were being used. Number of nodes captured for a slow transaction trace was not being capped properly resulted in too much data being sent through to core application. This could result in details of slow transaction being rejected by core application, or result in a timeout in UI when attempting to display the slow transaction trace. SQL calls made using 'psycopg2' were failing where optional parameters argument was not supplied to database cursor 'execute()' method and the SQL contained a '%' character such as in a 'LIKE' clause. Was not ignoring exception of type 'bottle.HTTPError' raised within application using Bottle. This is not a true exception but is used to programmatically indicate a non 200 HTTP response so shouldn't have been recorded as an error. The 'django-piston' instrumentation was failing when an error occurred in users handler and it tried to generate an error response. This was because 'django-piston' was assuming that a handler would always be a normal function. It would therefore fail for a decorator/wrapper implemented using a class object as is used by the agent instrumentation. New features: Added support for capturing explain plans for slow SQL when using MySQL and PostgreSQL. Added preliminary public API for manually instrumenting additional functions in user code and interacting with the current transaction to override how and what details about the transaction are recorded. Added the 'transaction_tracer.function_trace' setting in the agent configuration file for providing a simplified way of specifying additional Python functions for which time metrics should be collected. Time spent in these functions will then appear in web transaction performance break down and slow transaction traces. Added new or improved support for tracking external web service requests made using the 'urllib', 'urllib2', 'urllib3', 'httplib', 'httplib2' and 'requests' modules. Note that only time taken for the initial connect for the HTTP connection may be recorded. Uninstrumented time which appears immediately after an external web service request in a slow transaction trace made using one of these modules, will therefore possibly be the time then taken to send request data, wait for a response and consume that response data. Added support for tracking external requests to a Solr service using the 'pysolr' and 'solrpy' modules. Time spent making the request will show on the overview charts as Solr time. Metrics for individual types of requests will also be listed in web transaction performance breakdown and slow transaction traces. Added Django application called 'newrelic.extras.framework_django' which explicitly adds in 'newrelic_tags' tag library containing template tags for manually adding in RUM header and footer. Reliance on the old method whereby template tag library was added automatically is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Added support for Bottle 0.10.X in Bottle specific instrumentation. Added support for Redis using the 'redis' module. Support consists of tracking time spent connecting to and issuing commands against the Redis service. Added support for MongoDB using the 'pymongo' module. Support consists of tracking time spent connecting to and issuing commands against the MongoDB service. Features changed: The 'capture_params' setting was defaulting to 'true' rather than 'false' resulting in the request query string parameters being reported against errors and slow transaction traces. If upgrading you will need to change the agent configuration file you are already using to change it to 'false' if capturing parameters is not desired. Rollup metrics against web transactions for external web service requests will now only be recorded against the host and will not be broken out based on resource requested on the remote service.",

Notes This release of the Python agent contains a fix for when reporting to multiple applications, as well as other minor bug fixes and enhancements. For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the status of the Python agent . New features: On the Linux platform, the agent environment now reports the total amount of system memory available. Added support for psycopg2cffi database module. Custom parameters can be associated with function trace nodes for display against transaction traces in the UI. The URL associated with a call to an external service will now be shown in the custom parameters section for the node in a transaction trace. Previously would have been shown as a label when hovering other the node. Bug fixes/Improvements: The agent was not reporting any data where multiple applications were being listed in in the app_name configuration setting. Calling register_application() in the context of a module import could cause a temporary deadlock when a timeout period was specified. The potential for deadlock will now be detected and the function will return without waiting. When the agent was configured to capture query string parameters, a key with an empty value was being discarded and not reported. When using gevent mode of gunicorn, the SystemExit exception was being logged on process shutdown due to gevent sending the SystemExit exception to all greenlets and not just the main thread when sys.exit() was called. Instrumentation wrapping the Django reverse() function was not accepting named parameters. If custom parameters were used with a transaction, the HTTP response STATUS was duplicated in details related to an error raised from that transaction. Changes to Django instrumentation to avoid metric grouping issues resulting from raw URLs leaking through as transaction name.",

Fixes: Details of errors were not being captured and passed back to the core application to be displayed by the UI when the URL for the request had query string parameters. The problem was not causing failure of the overall web application but that a problem was occuring would have been identifiable though a Python agent exception and traceback being recorded in the Python agent log file with message: NameError: global name 'request_params' is not defined Slow transactions were never being recorded when agent run using method where no agent configuration file was being used. This is the case for example when using Heroku. New features: Added support for the distributed task queuing system Celery. Tasks executed by a Celery  server can be tracked and reported as background tasks against an application in the New Relic UI. Added support for tracking as external web service requests calls made out via the pywapi  module. Added support for automatic wrapping of WSGI application entry point when using flup  WSGI adapter for FASTCGI, SCGI and AJP.

    "description": "The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see Update the agent . For more information, see End-of-life policy . Fixes: Where instrumentation was not available for the web framework or toolkit being used and web transactions were being named according to the original URL, metric normalization rules were not being correctly applied when metric grouping issues occurred due to a large number of unique URLs. This was resulting in grouping of web transactions metrics under incorrect names leading to the data presented by the UI being unhelpful or misleading. Agent would fail when collecting WSGI hosting environment information when an older version of Tornado web server was used which did not provide version information. This would lead to no web transactions metrics being reported as failure occured when agent was trying to register with the New Relic core application. Instrumentation of the feedparser module was not catering for the fact that the parse() function could be supplied arguments beyond just the URL to be retreived. This would result in an exception and the web transaction always failing when such additional arguments were supplied. Instrumentation for Django was improved so that view handler function name was reported against a web transaction rather than URL when using Django static files mechanism. Instrumentation for Django was improved so that technical 404 and 500 response handler function name was used for web transaction when appropriate. Instrumentation for Django was improved to ensure that request middleware function name was always used for web transaction name when it returned a valid response. Features changed: Attributes captured from WSGI request environment such as 'REQUEST_METHOD', 'HTTP_REFERER' and 'HTTP_USER_AGENT' are now shown under the 'Request environment' category in error details and slow transaction traces rather than under 'Custom parameters'. The HTTP response status for a web transaction is now shown as 'STATUS' under the 'Response properties' category in error details and slow transaction traces rather than under 'Custom parameters'.",

    "description": "Notes This release of the Python agent drops support for Python 2.7 and adds the following: a Kafka server metric host and port attributes for memcache support for kafka-python-ng support for uvicorn_worker an environment variable for garbage collector (GC) runtime metrics automatic detection for the function signature in LangChain 's similarity_search updated support for OpenAI 's chat class a fix for a bug in gRPC's entity name detection a fix for transaction context propagation loss in LangChain  in the case of a new thread parsing of the request and response when running OpenAI  via LangChain a fix for pyscopg  v3 API incompatibilities a fix that removes versioned logic in loguru  instrumentation Install the agent using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or download it directly from the New Relic download site . Deprecations Remove Python 2.7 Support Removes compatibility with Python 2.7. Also removes support for the following libraries that were only supported on Python 2.7: umemcache oursql pywapi Pylons web2py weberror New features Add Kafka server metric Adds a metric to capture the host and port information for Kafka entities on both consumers and producers. This metric allows the UI to link AWS information with AWS MSK entities in the service map. Add capturing of memcache host and port Adds capturing of host and port info on the following memcache libraries: bmemcached , aiomcache , and pymemcache . This allows the UI to link AWS information with AWS memcache entities in the service map. Add support for kafka-python-ng kafka-python  has been released under a new name: kafka-python-ng . This continues to support kafka-python under the new package name. Add support for uvicorn_worker uvicorn.workers has been moved to a separate package called uvicorn_worker. This checks for both names of the module when reporting dispatcher information. Automatically detect function signature in LangChain  similarity_search Automatically detect the function signature when wrapping similarity_search. Add environment variable for garbage collector runtime metrics Garbage collector runtime metrics can now be enabled/disabled via the following environment variable: NEW_RELIC_GC_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED. Bug fixes Fix bug in gRPC entity name detection Previously, the gRPC channel entity name was missing the first character(s) in specific cases. This bug has been fixed. Fix issue in LangChain  where a thread is started and the transaction context is lost Previously, when LangChain called certain chains, such as retrieval chains, LangChain started a thread that caused the transaction to be lost, resulting in broken instrumentation. This has been fixed so the transaction context is passed across threads and instrumentation still works for retrieval chains. Fix parsing of request and response when running OpenAI  via LangChain Previously, when running OpenAI  via LangChain  the request and response were a different format and were not being recorded. This issue has been fixed. Instrument new path to OpenAI  chat completions class OpenAI  moved the ChatCompletions class to a different path which prevented the instrumentation from being applied. This has been fixed. Fix pyscopg  v3 API incompatibilities Expand DBAPI2 wrappers to allow arbitrary kwargs on executemany(). Upgrade psycopg  v3 instrumentation to allow arbitrary kwargs on executemany(). Rename existing psycopg v3 wrapper arguments to match the upstream library's names for compatibility. Remove versioned logic in loguru instrumentation Removed versioned logic in loguru  instrumentation to fix a bug that occurred when the version was undeterminable. Support statement We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old.

Previously this would cause a duplicate of the transaction metric to be displayed in the transaction breakdown chart Unified view for SQL database and NoSQL datastore products. The response time charts in the application overview page will now include NoSQL datastores, such as Cassandra and MongoDB,and also the product name of existing SQL databases such as MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, etc. For existing SQL databases, in addition to the existing breakdown of SQL statements and operations, the queries are now also associated with the database product being used. For NoSQL datastores, such as Cassandra and MongoDB, we have now added information about operations performed against those products, similar to what is being done for SQL databases. This new unified Databases page will enable the filtering of metrics and operations by product, and includes a table listing all operations. Because this introduces a notable change to how SQL database metrics are collected, it is important that you upgrade the agent version on all hosts. If you are unable to transition to the latest agent version on all hosts at the same time, you can still access old and new metric data for SQL databases, but the information will be split across two separate views.",

Upgraded @newrelic/superagent @newrelic/aws-sdk @newrelic/koa @newrelic/native-metrics and @newrelic/test-utilities to the latest major versions Removed Node 12 from CI workflows. Updated engines stanza to be >=14. Updated all versioned tests stanza to be >=14 Converted fs.rmdirSync to fs.rmSync in test/unit/config/config-location.test.js. Converted uses of /dev/null to os.devNull in tests. BREAKING : Removed certificate bundle from agent. The configuration value config.feature_flag.certificate_bundle will no longer work. The agent no-longer includes the New Relic certificate bundle when using the 'certificates' configuration (commonly with proxies). If you find this breaking your current environment, we recommend getting a CA bundle such as the one from Mozilla. BREAKING : The agent now excludes port when making external HTTPS requests to port 443 to be in compliance with the spec and other agents. Previous external segments would be named External/example.com:443 when using default HTTPS port.\nThe external segment will now be named External/example.com. BREAKING : Removed ability to disable async hooks based promise context tracking via the await_support feature flag. This also removes the legacy Promise instrumentation. Released the await_support feature flag. The agent now relies on async_hooks to track async promise propagation.  The net result is the if you had feature_flag.await_support set to false, the legacy instrumentation tracked every function in a promise chain as a separate segment. BREAKING : Removed instrumentation for the obsolete oracle  npm package. BREAKING : Updated the minimum version of pg to be 8.2.x.  This is the earliest support version that runs on Node 14+. BREAKING : Updated the minimum supported version of hapi to be >= v20.0.0. All versions < v20.0.0 are deprecated by hapi for security reasons, see their support policy . Dropped tests for hapi < v20.0.0. Bumped @newrelic/test-utilities to ^7.0.0. This new version of test utilities defaults the number of concurrent jobs to currently available CPUs. For local development on modern machines, this can speed up full versioned test runs by 30-40%. Introduced JOBS ENV var for agent versioned test runs to control number of attempted concurrent test folder runs. Set to 4 for CI runs in GHA.

Added experimental instrumentation for the undici  http client behind a feature flag. To enable undici support, add the following into your config: { feature_flag: { undici_instrumentation: true } }.  The support for undici client is Node.js 16.x as it takes advantage of the diagnostics_channel . Lastly, you must be using v4.7.0+  of the undici client for any of the instrumentation to work. Note: There are currently some state issues if requests to an app are made with keep alive and you have multiple undici requests being made in parallel. In this case, set feature_flag: { undici_async_tracking: false } which avoids these state issues at the cost of some broken segment nesting.",

Set application_logging.forwarding.enabled to false when High-security mode (HSM) is set. Enabled log forwarding by default in the example config. Added sent, seen, and dropped metrics that collected on every harvest cycle around log lines. Added supportability metrics for some popular logging frameworks. Added supportability metrics to record if the logging features are enabled. Added a storage mechanism to transactions to keep logs until transaction ends. Removed distributed tracing setting from example config. Fixed a typo in lib/instrumentation/core/child_process.js. Thanks to Eito Katagiri (@eitoball) for the contribution.

Upgraded @newrelic/superagent @newrelic/aws-sdk @newrelic/koa @newrelic/native-metrics and @newrelic/test-utilities to the latest major versions. Refactored creation of span event aggregator to prevent crash of gRPC when running on invalid Node.js version. Added check for minimum node version >= 12. Set package.json engines node field >= 12 and npm field to >=6. Removed Node v10 from ci workflow and smoke-test version matrix.

    "description": "Improvements Bumped @grpc/grpc-js to ^1.2.11. Bumped @grpc/proto-loader to ^0.5.6. Fixes Fixed issue where capturing axios request errors could result in a memory leak. The agent now clears error references on transaction end, which are not used for later processing. Errors returned from 'axios' requests contain a reference to the request object which deeper down has a handle to a promise in handleRequestError. The TraceSegment associated with that promise has a handle to the transaction, which through the error capture ultimately kept the promise in memory and prevented it from being destroyed to free-up the TraceSegment from the segment map. This change also has the benefit of  freeing up some memory early for transactions held onto for transaction traces. Agent no longer propagates segments for promises via async-hooks when the transaction associated with the parentSegment has ended. This change reduces the amount of context tracking work needed for certain rare edge-case scenarios involving promises.

Fixes Fixed bug where applications with multiple names on a dynamically named host (UUID like) would have instances consolidated, losing per-host breakdowns. Removed 'host' from agent 'identifier' override to prevent server safety mechanism from kicking in. Host will still be used to identify unique agent instances, so was unnecessary to include as part of the identifier. This also resulted in additional processing overhead on the backend. The identifier override is still kept in place with multiple application names to continue to allow uniquely identifying instances on the same host with multiple application names where the first name may be identical. For example app_name['myName', 'unique1'] and app_name['myName', 'unique2']. These names would consolidate down into a single instance on the same host without the identifier override.

    "description": "New Features Added support for W3C Trace Context, with easy upgrade from New Relic trace context. Distributed tracing now supports W3C Trace Context  headers for HTTP protocols when distributed tracing is enabled. Our implementation can accept and emit both the W3C trace header format and the New Relic trace header format. This simplifies agent upgrades, allowing trace context to be propagated between services with older and newer releases of New Relic agents. W3C trace header format will always be accepted and emitted. New Relic trace header format will be accepted, and you can optionally disable emission of the New Relic trace header format. When distributed tracing is enabled with distributed_tracing.enabled: true, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling TransactionHandle#acceptDistributedTraceHeaders or automatically via http instrumentation. When calling Transaction#insertDistributedTraceHeaders, or automatically via http instrumentation, the Node agent will include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header, unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Added TransactionHandle#acceptDistributedTraceHeaders API for accepting both New Relic and W3C Trace Context distributed traces. Deprecated TransactionHandle#acceptDistributedTracePayload which will be removed in a future major release.

As of Node 12, the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook will no longer be passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage used to relate a given promise rejection to the transaction it was scheduled in. BREAKING  Removed support for Node 6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is now Node v8. For further information on our support policy, see: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compa... . Bumped version of @newrelic/superagent instrumentation to v2.0.0. Bumped version of @newrelic/native-metrics to v5.0.0. BREAKING  Bumped version of @newrelic/koa instrumentation to v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa update includes changes to transaction naming in addition to dropping Node versions 6, 7, and 9. See @newrelic/koarelease notes for what was included in v2.0.0 and v3.0.0 updates. https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic-koa/blob/master/NEWS.md . BREAKING  max_samples_stored behavior has changed to replace max_samples_per_minute. max_samples_per_minute is no longer a configuration parameter. The new behavior for max_samples_stored is as follows: \"The agent will collect all events up to this number per minute. If there are more than that, a statistical sampling will be collected.\" This usage of the configuration is consistent with other New Relic APM agents. If your application has previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. No larger than 10k is recommended. Updated utilization callback test to point to a host that can't represent a valid provider. Previously, location where CI provider runs tests could cause test to fail. Added support for Promise.allSettled() method in Bluebird 3.7. Bumped mongodb dev dependency past security warning. Fixed mongodb versioned tests so they are self-contained by using version under test for setup/teardown instead of agent dev-dependency version. Forced filename resolution if not already cached on module load. This should not occur in normal/non-test scenarios but provides a fall-back to maintain functionality.

Previously, the agent would spend a lot of time sorting redundant arrays while calculating the exclusive time for the segments of a trace. This has been refactored into a single postorder traversal over the tree which will calculate the exclusive time for all segments in the subtree rooted at a given segment. Fixes Fixed a bug where data belonging to distributed traces starting in the Node.js agent would be prioritized over data produced from traces starting in other language agents. Previously, the agent would use the same random number for both the transaction priority (used for data sampling) and the distributed tracing trace sampling decision (whether to create DT data for a given transaction). This random number reuse resulted in a bias that caused data from distributed traces started in the Node.js agent to be prioritized above data that belongs to distributed traces started in other language agents.

    "description": "New features Added superagent as built-in instrumentation. This instrumentation just maintains transaction state when using the superagent module to make HTTP requests with either callbacks or promises. Updated noticeError API method to be partially functional in High-security mode. In HSM, any custom attributes will be ignored, but the error will still be tracked. This brings the Node agent in line with the behavior of other language agents. Added PromiseShim class for instrumenting promise libraries. Support for setting transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold to 0 has been added. Improvements Updated DT payload creation to use primary_application_id from connect response. Added protection against functions with modified prototypes in shim.applySegment. Replaced SQL ID hash generation algorithm with SHA1 instead of MD5 to allow usage in FIPS compliant environments. Leveraged 16 hex digits for creation of SQL ID. Upgraded ejs module to get rid of Github security warnings. The ejs module was only used for tests and not in main agent code. Changes DT payload configuration log messages to debug level as it is not uncommon for calls to occur before server configuration has been retrieved. Converted net instrumentation to use shim api. Converted child_process instrumentation to newer shim style. Converted Timers instrumentation to newer shim style. Converted zlib instrumentation to use shim API. Bug fixes Fixed codec.decode() callback bug that would re-call a callback with an error thrown within the callback. Fixed bug requiring Cross Application Tracing (CAT) to be enabled for Distributed Tracing (DT) createDistributedTracePayload and acceptDistributedTracePayload APIs to function. DT configuration will no longer consider CAT configuration. Fixed bug in wrap() that would fail to wrap callbacks if the callback index was 0. The agent now respects NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD. Previously, this environment variable was stored as a string. The environment variable is now stored as a float.",

    "description": "New features Added support for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through your distributed system. By showing the distributed activity through a unified view, you can troubleshoot and understand a complex system better than ever before. Distributed tracing is available with an APM Pro or equivalent subscription. To see a complete distributed trace, you need to enable the feature on a set of neighboring services. Enabling distributed tracing changes the behavior of some New Relic features, so carefully consult the transition guide  before you enable this feature. To enable distributed tracing, set distributed_tracing.enabled to true in your newrelic.js file, or set NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED in your environment. Added a warning for too-new versions of Node.js during agent startup. Appropriately obfuscated SQL statements will now be included in all transaction traces. Previously, the agent would only include the SQL statements if the corresponding query was sufficiently slow. Added ability to execute instrumentation functions in the context of the segment the segment descriptor is describing. All record* methods supplied by all instrumentation shim classes now allow for a function to be executed under the context of the segment the record call will produce.

Check if process.mainModule.filename exists before using in missing config file check. When the agent is preloaded with Node's --require flag, mainModule is not yet defined when the agent checks for a config file, resulting in a TypeError in the event that no config file exists. Defaulting to the file path being executed in process.argv ensures that the app will not crash when preloaded without a config file. Updated dev dependency tap to v12.0.1. Fixed identification of errors with express. Previously the call next('router') was considered an error. This is actually valid usage of express and will no longer generate an error. Removed debug.internal_metrics configuration. This legacy debug configuration was never used since trace-level logging provides everything this did and more. Upgraded optional dependency @newrelic/native-metrics to v3. With this update comes pre-built binaries for Node 5 and 7. GC metrics are also now aggregated in C++ until the agent is ready to harvest them instead of hopping into JS for each event. Added additional checks to uninstrumented ensuring that files with names matching instrumented modules do not result in a false uninstrumented status. For example, some users load config/env info before the agent. In that case, a file responsible for exporting DB config information (config/redis.js), may result in a false uninstrumented status, because the agent would interpret redis.js as the module itself.",

Improvements Added the WebFrameworkShim#savePossibleTransactionName method. This method may be used to mark the current running middleware as a potential responder. savePossibleTransactionName should be used if a middleware can't be determined to be a terminal middleware while it executes, but may be responsible for responding after execution has finished. Fixed dns.resolve results assertion. Expanded async_hooks tests around maintain transaction context. Added Koa to metric naming objects. Added callback prop to middlewareWithPromiseRecorder return spec. While we aren't actually wrapping any callback, this is a workaround that gives us access to the active segment. This ensures that all segments inside Koa transaction traces are named correctly, particularly in cases when transaction context may be lost. Updated after prop in middlewareWithPromiseRecorder return spec to set txInfo.errorHandled = true in cases when there is no error. Because Koa has no concept of errorware in the same sense as Express or Connect ((err, req, res, next)), the agent now assumes if a middleware resolves, any error that may have occurred can be marked as handled.

Added a split in the node versions for the mysql2 and cassandra versioned tests. As of mysql2 v1.3.1 and cassandra v3.4.0 the minimum supported version of Node is 4.

    "description": "New features Added agent attribute filtering via include and exclude rules. Agent attributes  can now be controlled using fine grained include and exclude rules. These rules, described below, replace capture_params and ignored_params. Any attributes listed in ignored_params will be migrated to attributes.exclude internally, unless attributes.exclude is explicitly set. There are three new configuration properties added to the root config and each destination (more on destinations later). These new configurations are: attributes.enabled - Enables collection of attributes for the destination. attributes.include - A list of attributes or wildcard rules to include. attributes.exclude - A list of attributes or wildcard rules to exclude. The include and exclude rules can be exact rules (for example request.headers.contentLength), or wildcard rules which match just the beginning of attribute keys (for example request.headers.* would match any request header). These rules can be specified globally at the root of the configuration, or for specific destinations. These destinations are: transaction_tracer - Controls transaction trace attributes. transaction_events - Controls transaction event attributes. error_collector - Controls error event attributes. browser_monitoring - Controls browser/RUM transaction attributes. Renamed addCustomParameter to addCustomAttribute. The addCustomParameter method is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release of the agent. The addCustomAttribute method is a drop-in replacement for it. Added cache to agent attribute filtering. To minimize the overhead of applying attribute rules, the agent caches results of filtering specific attribute keys and destinations. The cache is limited to 1000 destination-key pairs by default but can be configured with attributes.filter_cache_limit. This cache offers a 10x improvement for applying filter rules for cache-hits. Added allow_all_headers to config options and updated http instrumentation. When set to true, the agent will collect all request headers. This collection respects the agent attribute include and exclude rules. A default set of exclusion rules are provided in newrelic.js. These rules exclude all cookies and authentication headers. Segments may now be flagged as opaque, causing internal segments to be omitted from the transaction trace. Improvements Added limits for agent attributes to keep monitoring overhead down. Attribute keys and values are limited to 255 bytes each. Keys which are larger than 255 bytes are dropped, and a warning message is logged. Values larger than 255 bytes are truncated to 255 bytes, respecting multi-byte UTF-8 encoding. Custom attributes are limited to 64 per transaction. Attributes beyond the 64th are silently ignored. Added error to collector connection failure log message. Renamed request_uri attribute to request.uri. This brings the attribute name in line with all other request attributes. Updated https-proxy-agent dependency from ^0.3.5 to ^0.3.6. Updated versioned tests where applicable to ensure most minor versions of instrumented modules work as expected. Fixed stalling test for v1 line of Mongo driver. Added tests verifying Hapi 404 transactions result in correctly named metrics. The Hapi instrumentation was doing the correct thing, but we did not have tests for this specific case. Bug fixes The agent will no longer crash when crypto.DEFAULT_ENCODING has been changed. Previously, the agent would assume the result of hash.digest() was an instance of a Buffer. If crypto.DEFAULT_ENCODING is changed, hash.digest() will return a string and the agent would crash. The agent now ensures that the value is a Buffer instance before moving on. Fixed error if process.config.variables.node_prefix missing. If process.config.variables.node_prefix is falsey (which can happen if using electron, leading to this issue https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/new-relic-on-electron-nodejs/53601 ) the getGlobalPackages function in lib/environment.js will give an err when it shouldn't.

Making these properties non-enumerable can have an impact on the performance of the agent. Disabling this option may decrease agent overhead. Improvements Refactored promise instrumentation. This new instrumentation is far more performant than the previous and maintains a more sensible trace structure under a wider range of sequences. Added concurrent environment scanning, limited to 2 reads at a time. This improves the performance of dependency scanning at agent startup, allowing the agent to connect to our services more quickly. Refactored instrumentation tests to run against wide range of module versions. Instrumentation tests will be run against all supported major versions of every instrumented module. For releases, we will test against every supported minor version of the modules. This vastly improves our test coverage and should reduce the instances of regressions for specific versions of modules. Added tests for all  of bluebird's promise methods. These tests ensure that we 100% instrument bluebird. Some gaps in instrumentation were found and fixed. Anyone using bluebird should upgrade. Bug fixes Fixed a crashing error in the hapi instrumentation. When recording the execution of an extension listening to a server event (for example, 'onPreStart') the agent would crash due to the lack of a raw property on the first argument passed to the extension handler. The agent now checks the event before wrapping the extension handler and checks for the existence of the raw property before attempting to dereference off of it. Fixed an incompatibility with the npm module mimic-response. The agent's HTTP instrumentation previously did not play well with the way mimic-response copied properties from an http.IncomingMessage. This caused modules that relied on that process, such as got, to hang. Fixed naming rule testing tool to use same url scrubbing as the agent itself.",

    "description": "New features Added hapi v17 instrumentation Hapi v17 added support for promise-based middleware which broke transaction tracking in the agent. This caused issues in naming, as the agent will name the transaction after the path to the middleware that responded to a request. Added instrumentation for vision@5 Due to the way vision is mounted to the hapi server when using hapi v17.x, the agent's instrumentation would not pick up on the middleware being mounted. This new instrumentation now correctly times rendering done in the vision middleware. Added unwrapOnce method to shim object This new method can be used to unwrap a single layer of instrumentation. unwrapOnce is useful in cases where multiple instrumentations wrap the same method and unwrapping of the top level is required. Added isErrorWare checks around nameState.appendPath/nameState.popPath calls to avoid doubling up paths in transaction names Previously, the agent would append its transaction name with the path fragment where an error handler middleware was mounted.

Transaction state is now maintained in ChildProcess event listeners. Reducing logging verbosity in the SQL query obfuscator. Bug fixes Fixed a bug when a custom collector port was provided in the configuration that prevented redirected connections from working.

    "description": "Notes The New Relic Node Agent v2 is here! This release contains major changes to the agent instrumentation API, making it easier to create and distribute your own instrumentation for third party modules. Check out Upgrade the Node agent  or the Migration Guide  for more information on upgrading your application to this version. BREAKING: Reversed naming and ignore rules. Naming rules are now applied in the order they are defined. BREAKING: De-duplicated HTTP request transactions. Only one transaction is created per request event emitted by an HTTP server. Previously this was one transaction per listener per event emitted. BREAKING: Stopped swallowing outbound request errors. Errors emitted by outbound HTTP requests will no longer be swallowed by the agent. BREAKING: Node v0.8 is no longer supported. Minimum version is now v0.10. The v1 agent will continue to support Node 0.8 but will no longer receive updates. BREAKING: npm v1 is no longer supported. Minimum version is now v2.0.0. New features Added API for writing messaging framework instrumentation. Introduced new MessageShim class for writing instrumentation. This shim can be accessed using the newrelic.instrumentMessages() API method. Added amqplib instrumentation. Applications driven by amqplib consumers will now have transactions automatically created for consumed messages. See Troubleshoot message consumers  for more information on this instrumentation and its limitations. Advanced instrumentation API is now generally available. New methods for instrumenting common modules were introduced during the Agent v2 beta. These APIs are now available to everyone: newrelic.instrument()/Shim: This method can be used to instrument generic modules, such as connection pooling libraries, task schedulers, or anything else not covered by a specialized class. newrelic.instrumentDatastore()/DatastoreShim: This method is good for instrumenting datastore modules such as mongodb, mysql, or pg. newrelic.instrumentWebframework()/WebFrameworkShim: This method is used for instrumenting web frameworks like restify or express. Documentation and tutorials for the new API can be found on our GitHub documentation page: http://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/ Improvements Rewrote built-in instrumentation using the new Shim classes. The following instrumentations have been rewritten: Datastores cassandra-driver ioredis memcached mongodb mysql node-cassandra-cql pg redis Web frameworks director express hapi restify The @newrelic/native-metrics module is now included as an optional dependency. This module will be installed automatically with Agent v2. If it fails to install the agent will still function.",

Introduced new classes for writing instrumentation, Shim and DatastoreShim. These classes along with the new newrelic.instrument and newrelic.instrumentDatastore methods make writing 3rd party instrumentation much easier. Rewrote instrumentation for Cassandra, Redis, ioredis, MySQL, and MongoDB. These instrumentations were rewritten using the new DatastoreShim interface. Their functionality is largely unchanged but the new code should be easier to maintain and extend. Added public API documentation.

A new API method addCustomParameters() has been added to allow adding multiple custom parameters at once. Thanks to Austin Peterson (@AKPWebDesign) for this contribution! Improvements Updated tests to run on Node 7. Node 7 is officially supported as of the previous release, v1.33.0. The shutdown() API now waits for connection to collect pending data.

Notes Includes a nearly total rewrite of the connection layer that the module uses to communicate with New Relic's servers: More useful logs! All of the logging has been reviewed closely to maximize its value and usefulness at pretty much every level. In practice, this means that the messages logged at 'info' and higher should only be for things that are relevant to you as a customer, and at 'debug' and 'trace' should be much more useful for us when we help you isolate issues with New Relic in your applications. See data faster! As part of the connection handshake with New Relic, the module will now send any performance metrics gathered during the startup cycle immediately, instead of waiting a minute for the first full harvest cycle. Get data to New Relic more reliably! When the module has issues connecting to New Relic, it's more consistent and resilient about holding your performance data for later delivery. Use less bandwidth! Performance data delivery to New Relic is now sequential instead of simultaneous. This means that the bandwidth used by New Relic will be less bursty, especially on hosts running many instrumented applications (or cluster workers). Better implementation! There were a number of architectural problems with the old version of the connection layer, which (among other things) made it difficult to test.

    "description": "Notes This release has been unpublished from npmjs.org. Use version 1.27.1  or higher. New Features Reworked promise instrumentation to be more reliable and reusable. Promise instrumentation has been rewritten to be applicable to any A+ compliant promise library. This change brings more consistent instrumentation of Bluebird promises. This change also allows users to see the execution order of chained promises in their Transaction Traces. This is an opt-in process and can be achieved by setting feature_flag.promise_segments to true in the agent config. Bug fixes The agent now properly checks for custom SSL certificates. The check previously was falsely positive if there was an empty list of custom certificates. This caused red herrings to be admitted into the debug logs. Thanks to Seth Shober (@sethshober) for the fix! Promise error handling is now more consistent. Previously the agent would notice errors being emitted on unhandledRejection regardless of other listeners. Errors coming in on the unhandledRejection event will not be recorded if there are handlers for the event - this is more in line with our error handling practices in other instrumentations. Improvements Added a .npmignore file to exclude non-essential files. The agent will now omit tests and examples on install from npm, drastically improving download times. Thanks to Serge Havas (@Sinewyk) for the contribution! Logging has been reworked to reduce CPU overhead. The check to see if a logging call was valid happened fairly late in the logic, causing unnecessary work to be done regardless of logger state.

    "description": "New Features Added support for the new Response Time Line  and better representation of asynchronous data. This has many implications in the UI. The first is the Application Overview , in the past we've always just shown \"node\" and maybe \"request queueing \" on the response time graph. We now show you an application breakdown like our other language agents! This means you'll be able to see how much time was in HTTP externals, your various datastores, or spent in node itself. Overlaid on this will be your response time as a blue line. Next page that has been affected is our Transaction Overview  page. Specifically when you click into a Transaction to see more detail. Previously we showed you a breakdown of the top time consumers in that transaction, both as a graph and as a table. Unfortunately that graph didn't show response time and the table would show percentages over 100%. Now, like the Application Overview, you will get a blue response time line and the breakdown table will have numbers that add up much more intuitively! Finally, our Transaction Trace  view has also been updated. The change is very similar to the changes mentioned above for the breakdown table in the Transaction Overview page. You should no longer see percentages over 100% here either. Improvements Transaction trace serialization is now 4x faster than before. This speedup will primarily affect those with large, deeply nested transactions. Though small transactions have seen some improvement as well.",

Notes: Before, there were certain circumstances under which an application would crash without New Relic installed, but wouldn't crash with it. This has been fixed, and applications with New Relic installed now crash consistently. The error tracer is now also considerably simpler. Added a security policy. See the new section in README.md or read SECURITY.md. Future-proofed the MongoDB instrumentation and prevented the module from breaking GridFS. Made a small tweak that should reduce the amount of blocking file I/O done by the module. The module's instrumentation and harvest cycle will now not hold the process open in Node 0.9+. This should make it easier for processes to shut themselves down cleanly with New Relic running. The environment information gatherer will no longer crash if it tries to read a directory where it's expecting a file. Errors thrown during the execution of Express routes or Connect middlewares that were attached to requests that ended in HTTP status codes configured to be ignored by default will now be ignored correctly. Made the module play nicer with Node's REPL. It no longer assumes that an application necessarily has a main module. A few tweaks were made to support the CoolBeans dependency injection framework. Several log messages were demoted to a less chatty level.",

    "description": "The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see Update the agent . For more information, see End-of-life policy . Notes Added support for Label Categories The agent now supports setting Labels for your application on a per instance level, using either an environment variable, or a config file setting. https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/categories-... Improved transaction names for express 4 express 4 added the ability to mount apps and routers at specific urls. The node agent would previously use only the portion of the route that was the last router or app matched as the transaction name. Transaction names will now include the entire matched route. Added detection for uninstrumented instances of modules that should be instrumented The agent will now detect if an application has required a module before require('newrelic') .If this occurs, the agent will add a warning in the log file and display a warning banner in the UI. Added more logging to custom instrumentation APIs at debug level. The logging was improved for the benefit of people using the following APIs: createTracer, createWebTransaction, createBackgroundTransaction, and endTransaction. It will log when transactions are created and when transactions are ended. It will also log when it can't create a tracer due to there being no active transaction. Fixed a bug in PostgreSQL instrumentation where the event emitter from query could not chain .on calls. This patch was contributed by sebastianhoitz . Fixed a bug in createBackgroundTransaction where if the agent was disabled it didn't take a group argument. This patch was contributed by nullvariable . Fixed a bug in our URL parsing where in Node v0.11.14 url.parse returns a differently shaped object than expected. This patch was contributed by atomantic Note : Node v0.11.x is not officially supported, but Node v0.12 will be and this patch helps us get ready for that.",

The agent no longer renames transactions for requests that end in error to the gnomic and unhelpful '400/*' (or whatever the final HTTP status code ends up being). This should make the traced errors tab considerably more useful. Improved instrumentation for legacy http.createClient and http.Client client methods. A few modules still use these legacy API calls, and the old instrumentation was just plain wrong. Changed how the error tracer deals with certain kinds of errors to deal with differences between Node versions 0.8 and 0.10. It should now convert throws into fatal errors less frequently. Removed useless fs.readDir instrumentation, which generated a lot of metrics but which New Relic was unable to display in any useful form.

Notes: Added a new call to the API, .noticeError. See the docs  for details, but unlike the other calls on the API, you can use this to pass off errors anywhere in your app, not just from within web requests. Ignoring slow (or polling) requests was only being applied to slow transaction traces. It now applies to metrics and transactions that end in errors. MongoDB, Redis and Memcached now honor the capture_params and ignored_params settings. New Relic for Node.js, like New Relic's other agents, has a sophisticated system for repeatedly trying to connect to New Relic's servers when the first attempt results in failure. This had been broken since (roughly) January. It works again now. The built-in debugging for the transaction tracer was out of date with respect to the production tracer. This is fixed, and you're welcome to satisfy your curiosity by enabling it, but it's really not going to be useful to you unless you feel like taking the time to understand what the tracer is doing at a low level. Do not ever enable it in production, as it degrades the tracer's performance and generates a huge pile of objects per transaction.",

    "description": "Notes ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES Removed support for Node 14. Replaced ESM loader with import-in-the-middle to fix instrumentation firing for both CommonJS and ESM. You must load both the ESM loader and agent as follows: node --experimental-loader newrelic/esm-loader.mjs -r newrelic path/to/app.js. Removed config.esm.custom_instrumentation_entrypoint to register ESM instrumentation. You can now just call the newrelic.instrument* APIs but you must pass in an object and specify isEsm: true. See example . Updated agent to use require-in-the-middle to register CommonJS instrumentation. You can no longer use an onResolved hook to register custom instrumentation. Updated the default context manager to be AsyncLocalContextManager. Renamed shim.handleCATHeaders to shim.handleMqTracingHeaders. Updated agent to only run in the main thread. This is because running in a worker thread does not completely function out of the box. This will reduce the overhead for customers that are naively trying to load this into worker threads. Features Added support for Node 20. Renamed shim.handleCATHeaders to shim.handleMqTracingHeaders (#1735 ) (6788f9e ) If you have calls to shim.handleCATHeaders, the signature is identical and a function name change is only necessary. Note : The agent will be removing CAT functionality in an upcoming release. Updated the default context manager to be AsyncLocalContextManager (#1731 ) (25f2bd8 ) To restore functionality of legacy context manager you can set config.feature_flag.legacy_context_manager to true or `NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG_LEGACY_CONTEXT_MANAGER=true Please note this legacy context manager will be removed in future major releases. If you have any issues, please raise with New Relic support or on the issues  of the agent. Bug Fixes Replaced esm loader with import-in-the-middle to fix instrumentation firing for both commonjs and esm (#1760 ) (4452354 ), closes 1646 Breaking Change : Updated ESM loader that now requires to use both a loader and -r. node --experimental-loader newrelic/esm-loader.mjs -r newrelic path/to/app.js Breaking Change : Removed config.esm.custom_instrumentation_entrypoint to register ESM instrumentation. You can now just call the newrelic.instrument* APIs but you must pass in an object and specify isEsm: true. Updated prisma instrumentation to parse prisma datamodel with internal package (#1765 ) (48079b3 ) Code Refactoring Updated agent to use require-in-the-middle to register CommonJS instrumentation (#1758 ) (d4b4f11 ) Removed onResolved hook. If you're using custom instrumentation with an onResolved hook, you must update to use onRequire You can no longer instrument files that are not within a node_module unless you provide an absolute path to the file when registering the instrumentation. You cannot instrument both the base module and a sub module. Miscellaneous Chores Remove support for Node 14 (#1756 ) (0ff9912 ) Updated the bundled packages to the latest @newrelic/superagent, @newrelic/aws-sdk, @newrelic/koa, @newrelic/native-metrics, and @newrelic/test-utilities (#1766 ) (8f6e15b ) Updated the aws-sdk external branch to be main now that the code is in there (#1761 ) (d34d0fe ) Tests update smoke tests versioned matrix in CI to 16, 18, and 20.

Notes: Added a new setIgnoreTransaction call to the exported API to allow explicit control over whether transactions should be ignored or not. Mark those polling routes to be ignored! Pull your crazy custom favicon.ico renderer out of the ignore list! The module will no longer pollute MongoDB queries with New Relic-only parameters. Thanks to Alon Salant for identifying this issue, and all apologies to him for the trouble it caused him. The instrumentation for MongoDB, memcached, Redis, and Express will now honor the setting of the capture_params configuration flag. Before the module always captured query parameters. Fixed a problem that would cause New Relic for Node to fail on versions of Node between 0.8.0 and 0.8.3. Upgraded to the newest version of continuation-local-storage, which has many fixes for dealing with monkeypatched EventEmitters.",

    "description": "Notes BREAKING  - Updated the default of config.transaction_tracer.record_sql from off to obfuscated. This means that sql statements will be captured but obfuscated. BREAKING  - Route (URL) parameters are now stored as request.parameters.route.* attributes on Transactions, root Segments and Spans. After this change, the following becomes true: Query parameters will be available as attributes prefixed with request.parameters.* on Transactions and Spans. Route parameters will be available as attributes prefixed with request.parameters.route.* on Transactions and Spans. Route parameters (aka url parameters) are a common feature of various web frameworks, where you can create a placeholder as part of an API route definition. For example, given the following Express route definition and request url: The route parameter is id, and has a value of abc123. This would become request.parameters.route.id: abc123 on the Transaction, root Segment, and Span attributes. This example also has a query parameter of id, which has a value of true. This would become request.parameters.id: true on the Transaction, root Segment, and Span attributes. BREAKING  - Removed captureUrlParams from WebFrameworkShim class. DEPRECATION NOTICE : shim.unwrap and shim.unwrapOnce will no longer function if you attempt to unwrap an item that has been wrapped multiple times. This is because since we now allow instrumenting the same module more than once, you cannot safely unwrap without breaking all registered instrumentation.  We plan to remove shim.unwrap and shim.unwrapOnce in the next major release. Added the ability to register instrumentation multiple hooks (onRequire, onResolved) for the same resolved moduleName. This has been a limitation of the agent from the beginning. If you used the api to instrument api.instrument, api.instrumentDatastore, api.instrumentWebframework, api.instrumentMessages, or api.instrumentConglomerate, it would override existing instrumentation hooks.  The effect was that the Node.js agent would not function as designed. Refactored lib/transaction/tracecontext.js to reduce cognitive complexity. Refactored lib/transaction/trace/index.js to reduce cognitive complexity. Upgraded devDependencies jsdoc, and lean-jsdoc-theme.

We encourage you to adopt the newer version due to bug #1230 , which we fixed in #1237 , that was resolved in .NET agent version 10.1.0. New Features Adds support for logging metrics which shows the rate of log message by severity in the Logs chart in the APM Summary  view for Log4net, Serilog, and Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. This is enabled by default in this release. (#1034 ) Adds support for forwarding application logs to New Relic. This automatically sends enriched application logs for Log4net, Serilog, and Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. This is disabled by default in this release. (#1034 ) Adds support for enriching application logs written to disk or standard out for Log4net, Serilog, Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. This can be used with another log forwarder if in-agent log forwarding is not desired. We recommend enabling either log forwarding or local log decorating, but not both features. This is disabled by default in this release. To learn more about APM logs in context and the configuration options, please see the documentation here . (#1034 ) Adds flexibility to what is accepted to enable/disable boolean environment variables per FR #1008 . \"0\"/\"1\", and case insensitive \"true\"/\"false\" are now accepted.

MySqlConnector Support The MySqlConnector ADO.NET driver is instrumented by default. Fixes #85  and implements this suggestion . Nullable Reference Type support in the API Enables nullable reference types that are part of the C# 8.0 language specification and updates the signatures of API methods accordingly. There should be no required changes in API usage. Improved Support for NetTCP Binding in WCF Instrumentation When the NetTCP Binding type is used in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), the Agent will now send and receive trace context information in support of Distributed Tracing (DT) or Cross Application Tracing (CAT).

    "description": "New Features Infinite Tracing on New Relic Edge This release adds support for Infinite Tracing on New Relic Edge . Infinite Tracing observes 100% of your distributed traces and provides visualizations for the most actionable data so you have the examples of errors and long-running traces so you can better diagnose and troubleshoot your systems. You configure your agent to send traces to a trace observer in New Relic Edge. You view your distributed traces through the New Relic’s UI. There is no need to install a collector on your network. Infinite Tracing is currently available on a sign-up basis. If you would like to participate, please contact your sales representative. Agent version 8.30 introduces significant performance enhancements to Infinite Tracing. To use Infinite Tracing, please upgrade to version 8.30 or later. Error attributes now added to each span that exits with an error or exception Error attributes error.class and error.message are now included on the span event in which an error or exception was noticed, and, in the case of unhandled exceptions, on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error. The public API method NoticeError now attaches these error attributes to the currently executing span. Spans with error details are now highlighted red in the Distributed Tracing UI , and error details will expose the associated error.class and error.message. It is also now possible to see when an exception leaves the boundary of the span, and if it is caught in an ancestor span without reaching the entry span. NOTE: This “bubbling up” of exceptions will impact the error count when compared to prior behavior for the same trace. It is possible to have a trace that now has span errors without the trace level showing an error. If multiple errors occur on the same span, only the most recent error information is added to the attributes. Prior errors on the same span are overwritten. These span event attributes conform to ignored errors  configuration. Fixes Fixes issue in the MSI installer which prevented the InstrumentAllNETFramework feature selection from working as expected on the command line. Fixes issue for Azure App Service environments running on Linux that caused both the application and its Kudu process to be instrumented by the agent. The Kudu process is no longer instrumented. Fixes issue when using the ignoreErrors configuration . Previously, when an exception contained a inner exception(s), the ignoreErrors config was only applied to the outer-most exception. Now, both the outer-most and inner-most exception type are considered when evaluating the ignoreErrors configuration.

Fixes Fixes a number of issues caused when Application Initialization has been enabled in Internet Information Services (IIS) (a.k.a. AlwaysOn  in Azure App Services). The issues include the inability for the agent to name an app or possibly not instrument an app at all when app pool allow/deny listing has been applied via newrelic.config. In an Azure App Services scenario inadvertent instrumentation of the Kudu process could also occur. This was caused by the agent relying on the IIS environment variable APP_POOL_ID. When Application Initialization or AlwaysOn are enabled, the APP_POOL_ID environment variable is unavailable to the agent.

    "description": "New Features .NET agent installation procedures have been simplified for Windows environments enabling you to more easily monitor .NET Core applications. Our standard installation procedures  use a single MSI installer to install support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core applications. If you previously only monitored .NET Framework applications then nothing changes for you. If you were previously installing our .NET Core support using one of our manual install procedures you may need to port any custom modifications you have made to your newrelic.config  and any XML custom instrumentation  you have applied to the new install location. Trace Accessors APIs: two new API calls to obtain information used to support tracing. TraceMetadata  - returns a property with access to the following: TraceId - the currently executing trace's identifier. SpanId - the currently executing span's identifier. IsSampled - returns whether or not the current transaction is part of a sampled distributed trace. GetLinkingMetadata  - returns key/value pairs which can be used to correlate this application in the New Relic backend.

Fixed issue that could cause a SerializationException and cause metrics to be dropped. Fixed bug that would cause performance degradation for deeply nested segments. Fixes issue where scoped metrics would be dropped from an initial custom transaction when a second custom transaction was created. Impacts transaction created using the BackgroundThreadTracerFactory or the OtherTransactionWrapper via XML. Setting slowSql in newrelic.config to 'false' will now turn off slow SQL traces in the agent. This setting defaults to true. Server configuration values for this setting will override the value in the newrelic.config file. Removed the generation of unscoped metrics in cases where a transaction was not available. The generation of these metrics has been found to have a noticeable negative performance impact, particularly to low-latency/high-throughput applications. This impact typically shows up as a drop in throughput and higher CPU overhead. The vast majority of these metrics are not visible unless added to a custom dashboard. Datastore and External metrics, however, were visible on their respective pages and will no longer be displayed unless associated with a transaction. Fixed an issue when end-user monitoring is enabled that could cause some UTF-8 characters to get corrupted. The .NET agent now sends up the databaseDuration and externalDuration attributes when the value is 0. Upgrading Follow standard procedures to upgrade the .NET agent .

With the standard async-await pattern, as introduced in .NET 4.5, calls to async methods can return while work being done in the called method is still in progress. For supported libraries  and methods monitored with async custom instrumentation , the .NET agent observes this in-progress asynchronous work and waits for it to complete before recording timings. To take full advantage of features in this release please see this document . Fixes Fixed method segment naming for transaction traces to ensure consistency.

Without this configuration, async / await is undefined in ASP.NET and could result in intermittent drops of metrics or potential deadlocks. You may stop seeing some async metrics for your application unless you update its web.config file, as documented here: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/missing-... . For a brief description of this configuration, see the section here: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2012/11/19/all-about-httpruntime... Async mode : Fixed issue where High-security mode was filtering some attributes that are not sensitive. Async mode : Fixed an issue that could lead to missing external segments in some async transactions. Async mode : Fixed an issue in .NET 4.0 and older where in certain instances call stacks may not accurately get tracked due to ASP.NET thread agility. Async mode : Fixed issue where calling AgentApi.GetBrowserTimingHeader() did not prevent subsequent calls in the same transaction or auto browser injection from injecting duplicate JavaScript. Async mode : Fixed issue where setting browser monitoring auto instrument to false would prevent NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() from returning the header for manual injection. Enhanced the instrumentation for NServiceBus (receive side) so that when a service hosted by NServiceBus throws an unhandled exception while processing a service bus request, the New Relic Agent captures information about the error and generates an error trace.

Provides support for NServiceBus instrumentation, which will appear as transaction segments containing Message Broker , the queue name and the action (such as Produce  or Consume ). Since NServiceBus can be used for inter-application communication, nodes will also appear within the Cross-Application Tracing map  in APM. This release supports NServiceBus 5.0 and later. Fixes Fixes a bug where WCF applications hosted in IIS with compatibility mode disabled would not receive any useful transaction traces. Fixes a bug where WCF applications hosted in IIS with compatibility mode disabled would see twice as much throughput and *.svc transactions. Fixes a bug where some frameworks (WCF, Umbraco, DotNetNuke, etc.) were not having their transactions named as they were in agent 3.x and instead were getting named by the route. Fixed a bug where server-side redirects would cause transactions to be dropped. Fixes a bug where default page redirection in IIS classic pipeline mode would cause the redirection to fail and a 404 to occur instead. Fixes a bug where an exception could be thrown if the Content Type of an outgoing payload could not be parsed. Fixes an issue where the Azure Cloud Services NuGet package will not install on roles that are added as part of a second Cloud Service project.

New Features ASP.NET, MVC, and Web API instrumentation has been greatly improved. We now time each of the lifecycle events to help diagnose problematic areas of the .NET lifecycle such as session state lock contention. MVC and WebAPI should now properly wrap the time spent in controller actions inside the proper segment. We should now see far more exceptions that occur in your application, with full stack traces. The caveat here is that your error rate may appear to spike after upgrading and you may need to add some additional configuration to ignore more errors (or adjust error rate thresholds). Fixes Fixed a bug where WebAPI exceptions didn't contain stack traces. Increases the number of places during the ASP.NET Lifecycle that New Relic API methods that modify the transaction (like SetTransactionName) can be used. Provides support for instrumentation of methods on generic class types. Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause IIS to get into a bad state under certain load conditions where it would stop serving requests. This could be identified by an exception from IIS around System.Web.HttpApplication.PipelineStepManager.ResumeSteps.

The Stream Read has been removed and WriteHeaders should correctly report as being fast. In their place you will now see all the time occurring inside a call to Stream GetResponse. Fixed a bug in external request counting that would result in the counts being too high. The Original Url custom parameter will now contain the correct value if the application had re-written the Url in the BeginRequest event handler of an HttpModule.

Notes This is an interim release which addresses performance issues by temporarily disabling some features. Known issues At times, the agent may not release database connections quickly when the code being instrumented does not properly dispose of connections. Connections may not be returned to the pool until the one minute harvest cycle is reached. The Status Monitor diagnostics tool has the following known issues: Does not function correctly for IIS6 installations and applications running under sites other than DefaultWebSite. Shows incorrect information for some sites. Shows no reporting applications and an incorrect error message about IIS being in a stopped state in some cases where apps hosted on the machine are in fact reporting to New Relic. The agent writes too many messages to the log at INFO level. This can result in log files growing too large and a possible CPU impact. Work-around: set logging level to warning or above. In some cases, the agent may display incorrect counts for external calls. The Original URL displayed in the UI is not correct if the application uses an HttpModule to rewrite the url. In some cases, the agent may inject browser monitoring code in the wrong section of the page. This can cause pages to render incorrectly. Work-around: disable browser monitoring via the API for pages experiencing this issue. The agent reads its config file more frequently than necessary causing a potential performance problem for apps with very high frequency, very fast transactions. Auto RUM may not inject appropriately on pages where the content-type has optional parameters. This can result in no browser monitoring functionality for these pages. Generic exceptions cannot be ignored in the UI. Future upgrades from 2.8 to newer releases may not remove the newrelic.xml file. This may require manual cleanup.",

When automatically inserting the browser monitoring javascript, the agent now assures that a charset meta-tag continues to fall within the first 512 bytes of the document. Prior to this fix, insertion of the javascript may have pushed the charset meta-tag past the first 512 bytes, which would cause the character set not to be set, resulting in the browser setting the default to something that may not be what the developer intended.

Added back support for custom instrumenting methods via parameters='void' in the exactMethodMatcher. It is recommended you use the new way which is to simply leave the parameters attribute off of your exactMethodMatcher, but for those with existing instrumentation files using 'void' parameters that will once again work.",

    "description": "The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see Update the agent . For more information, see End-of-life policy . Notes Fixes Fixes an issue where content-type was being explicitly checked for \"text/HTML.\" In some frameworks, such as NancyFX , the charset was being added to the content-type before the New Relic HTTP module was loaded which caused the explicit check to fail and the RUM header and footer to not be added to the pages. Fixes an issue when the application results in a status code 404 or greater the metrics would be reported for the page not found instead of recording metrics for the 404 itself. This change also addresses an issue where assets such as png, css, js and so on would have metrics recorded for each individual asset instead of rolling them up into the appropriate asset group, such as *.png or *.css. Finally there were other metric grouping issues fixed where metrics were being named the custom route (such as /products/1) on some applications instead of using the name of the code asset that was doing the work to create the page (such as /products/productstemplate.aspx). Corrects functionality of the Status Monitor for IIS6 installations and applications running under sites other than DefaultWebSite. New Features A thread profiler  has been added to the .NET agent. The thread profiler is a low-impact profiling tool that can be used in production to identify bottlenecks in an application. Improvements Improves the logic around the RUM response filters which reduces the overall overhead of the .NET agent. Log files now have windows style line endings so they display correctly in notepad.exe. The status monitor tray application will now prompt for elevation on launch rather than error at runtime when it doesn't have correct permissions. Azure Cloud Services nuget package : Modified the package so that when installing a new version it will attempt an upgrade if an existing agent is installed. (This feature requires Nuget v.2.6 which prompts the user to overwrite existing / modified files - the newrelic.cmd must be overwritten to apply the new commands on the cloud service) Azure Cloud Services nuget package : The package now properly cleans up the environment variables out of the csdef when an uninstall or update occurs. Azure Cloud Services nuget package : For Worker Roles, the msiexec command in the newrelic.cmd file as been changed so that when the agent is installed it will install it for all CLR based applications.",

The Infinite Tracing feature depends on the gRPC framework to send streaming data to New Relic. The gRPC library currently in use, gRPC Core , has been in the maintenance-only phase since May 2021, and will be deprecated as of May 2023. The .NET Agent on .NET Core has been migrated to gRPC for .NET  per the guidance from grpc.io. However, this library doesn't have the full functionality that is required for Infinite Tracing on .NET Framework applications. Those applications will continue to use gRPC Core  until May 2023, at which time we'll end support for Infinite Tracing for .NET Framework. We may revisit this decision in the future if the situation changes. #1367 Other Resolved several static code analysis warnings relating to unused variables and outdated api usage. #1369 Update gRPC log message when a response stream is automatically cancelled due to no messages in a time period. #1378 Proxy configuration for Infinite Tracing should be specified using only the https_proxy environment variable. grpc_proxy is no longer supported for all application types.

    "description": "The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see Update the agent . For more information, see End-of-life policy . Notes This release marks the start of a brand new series of PHP agent releases. This represents many months of performance tuning, stability improvements and additional new features. All existing users are highly encouraged to upgrade to the latest agent. There are many changes in this version, the most interesting of which are listed below. All users who are upgrading from a previous release are encouraged to read the upgrade notes  document to fully understand some of the impacts of upgrading. Highlights of this release include: Drastic memory usage reduction. The agent overhead is down from approximately 35% to just 4%. Significantly less stack space used (down from 40K per PHP function call to just 84 bytes). This affects users with deeply recursive functions. License keys are now set in the INI file and not the daemon configuration file, and they are settable on a per-directory or per-virtual host basis. This very frequently requested feature will allow multi-tenant sites to use different keys for each tenant. The New Relic daemon can now be started automatically by the agent. For upgrade customers it will still be started the way it always was with the init scripts, but you can now change that by configuring the daemon in your INI file. Please see this page on daemon startup modes  for details. Several bugs related to auto-RUM (Real User Monitoring) have been fixed, including a fix for non-standard HTML (where the head element is at the end of the document). The agent startup \"banner\" now contains much more useful information that can be included in the initial dialog with support, and will short-circuit the typical \"what OS and PHP version are you using exactly?\" preamble to getting a ticket resolved. The agent and daemon no longer use a UNIX-domain socket for their communications. Now a standard TCP socket (port 33142 by default) is used, which makes deploying in a chroot environment a lot easier. The RPM and Debian packages have been split into three separate packages: the agent, the daemon and common scripts between the two. This was primarily done so that the agent was in its own package, and on 64-bit systems the agent package now only contains the 64-bit agent. This means that 64-bit users do not have to install the entire 32-bit runtime just to install the PHP agent. The 32-bit agent can always be installed alongside the 64-bit one. The phpinfo() output has been changed to more clearly distinguish between global and per-directory settings. It now also correctly displays the per-directory value if the script was invoked from within a directory that changed default values. The newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100 setting has been renamed to newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. You can now arbitrarily begin and end transactions (for example, at the beginning and end of each job queue unit of work). This is done using the new newrelic_end_transaction and newrelic_start_transaction API calls. The daemon has been considerably simplified and uses fewer locks, thus reducing the potential for entering a \"spin\" state. Many other improvements to speed and stability.",

    "description": "New Features Support for W3C Trace Context, with easy upgrade from New Relic trace context Distributed Tracing now supports W3C Trace Context headers for HTTP protocols when distributed tracing is enabled. Our implementation can accept and emit both W3C trace header format and New Relic trace header format. This simplifies agent upgrades, allowing trace context to be propagated between services with older and newer releases of New Relic agents. W3C trace header format will always be accepted and emitted. New Relic trace header format will be accepted, and you can optionally disable emission of the New Relic trace header format. When distributed tracing is enabled, there are two new API function calls available that now support W3C tracestate and traceparent distributed tracing headers in addition to the New Relic distributed tracing header information: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers()  is used to add distributed tracing headers newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers()  is used to accept distributed tracing headers When distributed tracing is enabled, you can use the new configuration setting newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header  to exclude the New Relic distributing tracing header and only rely on W3C Trace Context headers. Bug fixes Fixed a case where the memory usage of the PHP agent increases when newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli  limit is reached. In rare cases, optimized segment data structures could cause crashes for long-running transactions that hit the segment limit set via newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli  or newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web .

    "description": "New Features Enhanced visibility into curl_multi_exec calls Previously, curl_multi_exec requests appeared as one segment with one total time. Now, we expose the individual segments of a curl_multi_exec request that include individual times and host details. This provides greater visibility as to which URLs are being called and improved ability to troubleshoot slow curl calls. Configurable daemon start timeout The PHP Agent has introduced a new configuration newrelic.daemon.start_timeout. Customers may use this to specify a timeout for the agent to wait for the daemon after a daemon was launched by the agent. With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the launched daemon hasn't acquired a socket yet, but rather grants the daemon time to do so. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Upgrade Notice For cross agent conformance, the agent attribute httpResponseCode has been renamed to http.statusCode. In PHP agent release 9.4 , we erroneously introduced httpResponseCode as the replacement for response.statusCode. The new http.statusCode agent attribute name will align with other agents and enables standardized alerts and INSIGHTS queries based on a common attribute name. Attributes are reported with both the new http.statusCode name and thelegacy httpResponseCode and response.statusCode attribute names. Support for legacy attribute names will be removed in future agent versions.

    "description": "Known issues and workarounds Potential memory exhaustion for long running transactions See description and recommendations under Known issues and workarounds  in the PHP 9.0.0.242 release notes . New features in 9.4 Added support for PHP 7.4 The PHP agent can detect libraries and frameworks that were preloaded via the opcache.preload  setting. You can disable this feature by using the following configuration setting: newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection = false . Request URI attribute is now captured We now capture the request.uri  attribute. The request URI appears in transaction queries in New Relic Insights. You can disable this attribute by using the following configuration setting: newrelic.attributes.exclude = \"request.uri\" . Upgrade Notices For cross agent conformance, the agent attributes request.headers.User-Agent and httpResponseCode are renamed to request.headers.userAgent and response.statusCode. The value response.StatusCode is changed to an integer. Attributes are reported with both the new and the legacy attribute names. Support for legacy attribute names will be removed in future agent versions. Bug Fixes Since 9.0, transaction traces and span events were not created when newrelic_end_transaction was called inside a PHP function. newrelic_end_transaction now creates transaction traces and span events in any case. It reports all traces and span events for segments that weren't ended at the time of its invocation as unknown. Since 9.0, Predis calls weren't instrumented when the Predis client was loaded from a path ending in Predis/Client.php. This has been fixed. For inbound distributed tracing payloads with invalid or missing values for pr (priority) and/or sa (sampled) the agent used to assign a default priority of -1 and/or a default sampled value of false to the transaction. This has been fixed, the agent now keeps initial priority and sampled values if the respective values in the inbound distributed tracing payload are missing or invalid. The daemon used to erroneously send SIGUSR1 signals to its parent process group in case one of the flags --foreground or --watchdog-foreground was given. This has been fixed.",

This call returns an opaque map of key/value pairs that can be used to correlate this application to other data in the New Relic backend. A new API function newrelic_get_trace_metadata()  has been added.

Configurable connection timeout The PHP agent has introduced a new configuration newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout . Customers may use this to specify a timeout for the agent to wait for a daemon connection. With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start.",

    "description": "New features in 9.2 More flexibility for container deployments The PHP daemon and agent no longer have to reside on the same host and can now communicate over a IPv4 or IPv6 TCP socket. This can be configured via the newrelic.daemon.address setting in the agent and the --address command line option for the daemon. When terminating the New Relic PHP daemon via the SIGTERM signal (and/or the SIGINT signal if started with the -f, --foreground flag), the daemon will now send all buffered data to New Relic prior to exiting. The PHP daemon has introduced a new configuration --watchdog-foreground. This keeps the daemon watchdog process in the foreground, whereas the --foreground configuration keeps the daemon worker process in the foreground. The new configuration makes it possible to use the daemon in a blocking way, without losing the additional stability provided by the watchdog process. Upgrade notices The PHP agent has introduced a new configuration newrelic.daemon.address which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You may use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Similarly, the PHP daemon has introduced a new configuration --address which serves as an alias to --port. Customers may use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, --address takes precedence. When starting the daemon as an external process, the daemon will now wait for up to three seconds for the listening port to be ready to receive connections before forking into the background. This usually occurs in (much) less than a second, and most users with this configuration will notice no difference in practice. The time that the daemon will wait can be controlled by setting the --wait-for-port setting with a duration. This duration may be 0 to prevent any blocking. If the option is omitted, the default value is 3s. Note that this is not the default configuration shipped with the PHP agent, and generally is only used in conjunction with the PHP agent configured with newrelic.daemon.dont_launch set to 3. Daemons started in foreground mode (with the --foreground flag) are unaffected, and will behave as before. Bug fixes When duplicating database connections to generate explain plans, the agent will no longer make those connections persistent, even if the original connection was persistent. The daemon now synchronously handles critical code paths related to harvesting and merging transaction data. This prevents crashes caused by race conditions. Previously, the PHP agent was silently ignoring the setting newrelic.daemon.port if the value was outside of the range 1 - 65535. In this case, it used the default value of /tmp/.newrelic.sock. The PHP agent no longer silently ignores these port values; it now logs these errors in php_agent.log. Known issues and workarounds Potential memory exhaustion for long running transactions.

    "description": "New Features With the addition of attributes on spans, the PHP agent now fully supports Infinite Tracing on New Relic Edge . Infinite Tracing observes 100% of your distributed traces and provides visualizations for the most actionable data so you have the examples of errors and long-running traces so you can better diagnose and troubleshoot your systems. You configure your agent  to send traces to a trace observer in New Relic Edge. You view your distributed traces through the New Relic’s UI. There is no need to install a collector on your network. Infinite Tracing is currently available on a sign-up basis. If you would like to participate, please contact your sales representative. Added support for attributes on spans. All custom attributes and some agent attributes previously applied as “Transaction events” are now also applied to the currently executing span, subject to the new span configuration settings. Added the transaction.name to spans. Added http.statusCode to external spans, representing the status code on an http response. Added error attributes to each span that exits with an error or exception. error.class and error.message are now included on the span in which an error or exception was noticed, and, in the case of unhandled exceptions, on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error. Also, the public API method newrelic_notice_error  now attaches these error attributes to the currently executing span, while still creating a Transaction Error event. Spans with error details are now highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI , and error details will expose the associated error.class and error.message. It is also now possible to see when an exception leaves the boundary of the span, and if it is caught in an ancestor span without reaching the entry span. NOTE: This “bubbling up” of exceptions will impact the error count when compared to prior behavior for the same trace. It is possible now to have a trace that has span errors without showing an error on the root span or entry spans. Added a new API method newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter  that allows adding custom attributes to spans. This is independent of the transaction; using this new API to add custom attributes to spans does not add them to transactions. If the maximum number of custom attributes is reached, span-level custom attributes take precedence over transaction-level custom attributes. Added the following span event attributes configuration to enable attribute filtering for spans: newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled newrelic.span_events.attributes.include newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Note: Security recommendation—Review your Transaction attributes configuration. Any attribute include or exclude settings specific to Transaction events, should be applied to your Span attributes configuration or your global attributes configuration. Bug Fixes In cases where the agent is configured to connect to the hostname of a daemon that exists in a separate container/host, after successfully connecting, the agent would not attempt to resolve the IP address again. This was seen when the daemon container/host goes down and then comes up again with a new IP address. Now, the agent will wait 45 seconds since either the last known good connection or the last IP address resolution and will attempt to resolve an IP address again.",

    "description": "New features in 9.0 Detailed transaction traces now available when distributed tracing is enabled. This release includes a refactor of segment storage to allow the agent to sort and apply different prioritization of segments that are used for transaction traces instead of distributed tracing. The PHP agent 8.4 release included limited support for distributed tracing, which resulted in the loss of detailed transaction traces for individual PHP services when distributed tracing was enabled. The refactor in this new release allows the agent to send up the segments (spans) you want to view for a distributed trace that includes PHP services. It also separately provides as much segment detail as possible when exploring transaction traces for an individual PHP service. Notes: The instructions to enable distributed tracing  have not changed with this release. The behavior of newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail has changed when distributed tracing is on. In the 8.4 - 8.7 PHP agent releases, newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail was disabled when distributed tracing was enabled. That is no longer the case. For more information, see the documentation for configuring trace level detail when using distributed tracing . To enable the improved support for distributed tracing, the PHP agent's memory allocation strategy has changed in 9.0. The PHP agent will more aggressively allocate memory when a transaction starts, and the system allocator may choose not to release that memory back to the operating system immediately, depending on the configuration of the operating system kernel and C library. As a result, the memory usage of the PHP processes may now be higher than it was with previous versions of the PHP agent. Upgrade notices for 9.0 With these distributed tracing enhancements, please check threshold values . In the 8.4 - 8.7 PHP agent releases, we recommended that customers set newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 so that the agent would report complete distributed traces even when a lightweight PHP service was part of the trace. This is no longer necessary. When upgrading to the 9.0 release, we recommend that you review your newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold settings, and return this value to its default or some higher value that is sensible for the application. The daemon will now issue a warning if it cannot find a root certificate bundle on startup. The daemon includes its own certificates and will still operate, but a future version of the PHP agent will remove the built-in certificates. At that point the PHP agent will not be able to communicate with New Relic's servers. Recommendation:  Ensure a root certificate bundle is installed on your host or in your container before using the PHP agent. This is generally available on most Linux distributions as a ca-certificates package. On FreeBSD, a bundle is available via the security/ca_root_nss package in ports. The daemon may no longer be invoked with the --tls flag. As of PHP agent version 8.0.0 the newrelic.daemon.ssl ini setting had been removed to increase security, but you could still invoke the daemon from the command line with --tls true. Command-line invocations of the daemon with the --tls flag will cause the invocation to fail. As with all PHP agent versions since 8.0.0, TLS is always used for communication with New Relic servers. Bug fixes A potential segfault when using drupal_http_request under PHP 7.3 has been fixed. In some cases, starting a new transaction during a request (via newrelic_start_transaction or newrelic_set_appname) could result in an incomplete state of framework and user function instrumentation. When obfuscating SQL, comments are stripped without any loss of the SQL itself. Predis 0.8 commands that used the synchronous executeCommand() code path (for example, HSET) on a clustered connection did not generate metrics. This has been fixed. Known issues and workarounds Potential memory exhaustion for long running transactions PHP agent 9.x uses more memory than previous versions, as it is less aggressive about freeing the memory used to track function calls and segments during transactions: in the normal case, memory is only freed at the end of each transaction. This tends to manifest mainly for users with long running transactions, such as background jobs to process message queues, transform or report on data, or send e-mails. We apologize for the inconvenience this issue has caused, and are actively working to fix it. In the short term, we have four potential workarounds to mitigate this issue. Workarounds: 1. Start/stop transactions manually.  If the affected transaction is one that performs a series of repetitive processes, such as a message queue consumer, you can manually instrument each iteration as a separate transaction. This provides you more fine-grained data on how the process is operating. By doing this, the memory used will be freed after each transaction. To implement this, you would ignore the initial automatic trans…",

When enabled, internal functions will appear in transaction traces like PHP functions. Note that enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. Bug Fixes In some cases, Magento 2's UI Component JSON data sources return with an (incorrect) Content-Type of text/html. This resulted in auto instrumentation insertions into JSON data that contained a <head> string. We now identify these specific JSON data sources and ensure the auto instrumentation is not inserted into this JSON data. On PHP 7, using file_get_contents() to get a HTTP URL in a function which also read from $http_response_header resulted in the external call not being linked correctly in the APM UI: the external call would appear in transaction traces without a link to the receiving application. This has been fixed. Using curl_setopt_array()  to set options on a cURL handle could result in cross application tracing failing. This has been fixed. When generating explain plans for queries issued with MySQLi, the PHP agent could bind parameters from the wrong query if the PHP object ID had been reused internally. This has been fixed. Due to a change in Laravel 5.5's router API, the PHP agent would crash when automatically naming a Laravel transaction. This has been fixed. On PHP 7, when naming transactions for the Laravel 5 framework, well-formed transaction names were being replaced by the too-generic $METHOD/index.php. This has been fixed.

If upgrading PHP is not possible, you can use apt-get and dpkg to install version 6.9 of the PHP agent and then hold that installed version by running these commands as root: Bug Fixes Automatic transaction naming has been fixed for Symfony 1  users who replaced the controller class via factories.yml  with one that did not call sfFrontWebController::dispatch() or sfController::forward(). Datastore metrics could not be generated for Predis  0.7 and 0.8 in version 7.1 of the PHP agent. This has been fixed. The agent would not report Zend_Http_Client  external calls when the Zend Framework was used directly as a library or indirectly by a framework like Symfony or Magento. This has been fixed.",

    "description": "New Features Support has been added for Laravel 5.3. Experimental Laravel Queue support. Experimental support for the Laravel Queue component  has been added. This supports all versions of Laravel from 4.0 to 5.3, inclusive. Whether run via artisan queue:listen or artisan queue:work, queue workers will now generate a separate background transaction for each job that is processed. These transactions will be named with the class name of the job, or IlluminateQueueClosure if a closure was queued. Additionally, a transaction that queues one or more jobs will be linked to the background transaction(s) that processed those jobs on the transaction map in the New Relic UI. To enable this support, you will need to set the laravel_queue feature flag in newrelic.ini. For most users, this will simply involve adding this line: newrelic.feature_flag=laravel_queue As this is presently an experimental feature, we would welcome feedback — both positive and negative — on whether this feature helps users using the Laravel Queue component better visualise the structure and performance of their applications. If all goes well, it is anticipated that Laravel Queue support will be enabled by default in a future version of the agent. Upgrade Notices Symfony 1 transactions that generate 404 errors due to no routes being matched will now be named based on the module and action that are actually used, rather than the module and action inferred from the request URL. In most cases, this will result in the transaction name being based on the error_404_module and error_404_action Symfony settings. Note that, as a result of this change, if the configured 404 action calls sfAction::forward() to forward to another action, the transaction name will be based on the final action. All other uses of sfAction::forward() are unaffected. Bug Fixes Previously, calling PDO::query with more than one argument resulted in the query being counted under the 'other' category on the Datastores page in the New Relic UI. This has been fixed. The agent will now correctly categorize the query as 'select', 'insert', 'update', or 'delete'. Previously, calling PDO::query with more than one argument resulted in the agent reporting \"(unknown sql)\" if the query was slow. (i.e., it exceeded the threshold given by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold  setting.) This has been fixed. Previously, calling SQLite3::querySingle with two arguments resulted in the query being counted under the 'other' category on the Datastores page in the New Relic UI. This has been fixed.

Transient Magento 2 tables now have the unique numbers removed from their names to avoid metric grouping issues. Pressflow 6 applications were incorrectly detected as Drupal 7 applications. This could cause POST requests made using drupal_http_request to be converted into GET requests. This has been fixed. Explain plan generation is now always performed on a separate database connection. This has been changed to avoid issues when using MySQL's SELECT FOUND_ROWS() feature. Previously, instrumenting method calls that resolved to __call() or __callStatic() calls could result in crashes on PHP 7. This primarily manifested in crashes for users of certain WordPress plugins (for example, wp-external-links) that registered hooks or actions that used magic methods. This has been fixed.",

Previously, a directory structure such as /usr/local/php/php/* would be detected as an installation of PHP in /usr/local/php, as the nested php directory would be wrongly assumed to be a PHP CLI binary. The installer now checks if the nested php (or php-config) is a directory, and ignores the path if so. Although this is likely to improve the installer in multiple environments, most noticeably, this fix removes erroneous messages about there being multiple PHP installations when installing the PHP agent within the Docker Hub's official PHP images .

Bug Fixes The first request in each PHP process would remove any output handlers installed using the output_handler configuration setting for users of PHP 5.4 and later. This has been fixed: existing output handlers will now remain untouched. Transient WordPress hooks now have the unique numbers removed from their names to avoid metric grouping issues.

The daemon can now be passed a --define <setting>=<value> flag that allows setting arbitrary parameters from your newrelic.cfg file. These parameters will take precedence over settings from that file. Drupal 8 requests that are successful full page cache hits for anonymous users (handled by Drupal\\page_cache\\StackMiddleware\\PageCache) are now given the name WebTransaction/Action/page_cache. Support for automatically naming transactions has been added for Symfony 2.8 and 3.0. Support for automatically naming transactions has been added for MediaWiki 1.18.0 and newer. Upgrade Notices It is now possible to disable reporting of errors for exceptions that are handled by an exception handler installed with set_exception_handler() by enabling the newrelic.error_collector.ignore_user_exception_handler setting. Calls to newrelic_notice_error with improper parameters will no longer record an error with the message \"?\". Instead, no error will be recorded. newrelic_notice_error will now return true if an error is saved, null if the arguments are invalid, and false otherwise. If newrelic_notice_error is called with two parameters and the second parameter is not a valid exception, no error will be recorded: The first parameter is now entirely unused. Bug Fixes On Redhat Enterprise Linux 7 and related systems such as CentOS and Fedora, the systemctl start|stop newrelic-daemon commands were not working due to a bug in the newrelic-daemon init script when executed by systemd. This has been fixed. On some Linux systems, an SELinux policy could prevent the newrelic-daemon from determining the correct hostname. Affected systems were unable to report data because a valid hostname is required by New Relic. This has been fixed.

Notes New Features Added new local setting to enable high-security mode. newrelic.high_security = false This setting is false by default. When set to true, this setting has the following effects: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using SSL. Raw SQL strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request parameters will never be captured, regardless of the value of newrelic.capture_params. The following API functions will have no effect, and will return false: newrelic_add_custom_parameter newrelic_set_user_attributes If you change this setting, you must also change the RPM UI security setting. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. Introduce new attribute configuration scheme. All parameters captured by the agent and created by the newrelic_add_custom_parameter API call are now considered attributes and have a new set of INI configuration options. As a result, the newrelic.capture_params and newrelic.ignored_params configuration options have been deprecated. The newrelic.ignored_params comparison will now be case-sensitive. For full information, please see the documentation . Bug Fixes The Laravel 4.0 framework is now supported in a manner analogous to the existing support for Laravel 4.1. (The portion of the routing code that is instrument changed the function names and arguments slightly going from Laravel 4.0 to Laravel 4.1.) Fix potential metric grouping issue with Kohana transaction naming. Previously, the agent would treat the first two segments of the request URI as the controller and action when no route was found. Now the agent will use 'unknown' as the transaction name when no route is found. This is consistent with the behavior for other frameworks.",

Notes End of Life Notices This release no longer supports BSD (either 32-bit or 64-bit) or the 32-bit variant of Mac OS X. New Features Add Laravel 4.0 support Laravel version 4.0 or greater is now supported natively. The naming scheme that we use follows the scheme developed by Patrick Leckey at Intouch Insight, and we are very grateful for his assistance. If you are already using the LaravelNewrelicServiceProvider from https://packagist.org/packages/intouch/laravel-newrelic  then we recommend removing that from the list of service providers, and relying on our native support instead. However, if you are using the custom naming mechanism with 'name_provider' from the intouch/laravel-newrelic package, then those transaction names will take precedence over our automatically generated transaction names. If you do use 'name_provider', please write us and let us know what your namer does so we might extend our built in capabilities. Bug Fixes Improved real user monitoring Javascript insertion. The real user monitoring Javascript loader will now be injected after any meta charset tag, ensuring that the meta charset tag is close to the beginning of the page. The real user monitoring Javascript footer will no longer be inserted into HTML comments or nested HTML iframes. Properly observe newrelic.ignored_params when capturing the request's URL. If newrelic.capture_params is true then the agent will capture the values within the $_REQUEST parameter and the full raw URL of the request. The contents of newrelic.ignored_params are used to selectively ignore values from $_REQUEST. The presence of newrelic.ignored_params will now also prevent the capturing of query parameters in the request URL. Fix transaction naming when newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions is present. When newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions had a non-empty value, the URL was being used as the default web transaction name instead of the PHP filename.

Notes We're happy to announce the availability of version 4.5.5.38 of the New Relic PHP Agent, featuring Drupal 8 instrumentation. More details below. End of Life Notices This release no longer supports any backdoor exceptions to run threaded Apache MPM. PHP itself is unstable in this environment. This is the last release of the PHP agent for BSD (either 32-bit or 64-bit.) This is the last release for the 32-bit variants of Mac OSX. 64-bit Mac OSX will still be supported. This release no longer ships with any backdoor support for PHP 5.1. New Features Experimental Drupal 8 support Drupal 8 is now supported by the PHP agent's framework detection code. This support should be considered \"experimental\" given the pre-release nature of Drupal 8. Drupal 8 applications will have their transactions named correctly, and will also generate the same module, hook and view metrics as Drupal 6 and 7 applications. This support can be forced by setting the newrelic.framework configuration setting to drupal8 if auto-detection fails. Upgrade Notices All customers running on old x86 hardware that does not support the SSE3 instruction set (such as early releases of the AMD Opteron) should upgrade to this release as soon as possible. Prior to this release, the daemon inadvertently contained SSE3 instructions which would cause an illegal instruction on such hardware. The only way the SSE3 instructions were executed was when we changed the choice and priority of SSL cipher algorithms at our data center, and we would like to change those priorities by the end of 2Q2014. Bug Fixes Fixed a bug with file_get_contents instrumentation. Fixed a bug which would cause the default context to be ignored by file_get_contents when a context parameter was not provided. This issue was causing customer API calls to fail in certain situations. The previous remedy was to disable cross-application tracing to work around the issue. This is now fixed.",

Notes This release of the New Relic PHP Agent improves real user monitoring and adds support for custom parameters in transaction analytics events. These changes were made to create a solid foundation for future enhancements. Additionally, an emphasis was placed on reducing the download size of the agent. As a result, the download size has been reduced by 75%. New Features Improve Real User Monitoring The PHP agent's code for both automatic and manual injection of Real User Monitoring scripts has been improved. No application changes are required, but the new injection logic is simpler, faster, more robust, and paves the way for future improvements to Real User Monitoring. Attach custom parameters to analytics events Custom parameters given to the agent through the API functions newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes can now be automatically attached to transaction and page view analytics events. By default custom parameters will be attached to traces, errors, and transaction analytics events. Optionally, custom parameters can also be included in the JavaScript injected for Real User Monitoring. This allows custom parameters to be attached to page view analytics events. The behavior of custom parameters can be controlled through the following configuration settings, which are shown with their default values. newrelic.transaction_tracer.capture_attributes = true newrelic.error_collector.capture_attributes = true newrelic.analytics_events.capture_attributes = true newrelic.browser_monitoring.capture_attributes = false",

Notes This release of the PHP agent automatically marks Drupal cron requests as background tasks, improves the categorization of PHP errors within the New Relic UI, and fixes several bugs. Additionally, the internals of the agent have been significantly refactored to improve the stability and performance of the agent. New Features Treat Drupal cron requests as background tasks Drupal cron requests (identified by calls to drupal_cron_run()) will now be counted as background tasks (not web transactions) regardless of how they are started. Previously, it was necessary to use the newrelic_background_job() API to explicitly mark Drupal cron requests as background tasks. Use the exception class as the category for errors Errors created using the newrelic_notice_error() API function with an exception will be grouped according to the exception's class. Previously, all errors were grouped under 'NoticedError'. See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/php/the-php-api#api-notice-error Limit the maximum number of nested PHP function calls The agent will now limit the maximum number of nested function calls within PHP applications. This is to provide protection against stack overflows due to infinite recursion. Previously, this would result in a segmentation fault. The agent will now log an error and terminate the process by raising a fatal PHP error. By default, this limit is set to a very high value of 500. Exceeding this limit should be extremely rare. Improve the stability and performance of the agent The internals of the agent and its background daemon process have been significantly refactored to improve interprocess communication, stability and performance. The maximum number of connections to the background daemon process has been doubled to 4096. Bug Fixes Fix for installing on Ubuntu 13.10 when using PHP-FPM Previously the installer would fail to install a newrelic.ini file in the configuration directory for PHP-FPM (/etc/php5/fpm/conf.d), if one was present. This has been fixed, and the installer will correctly install a newrelic.ini for CLI, DSO and FPM configuration directories. Fix for drupal_http_request() always returning NULL under PHP 5.5 Version 3.9.5.13 added support for external calls made using drupal_http_request(). Due to the way the agent instruments this function under PHP 5.5, this function would always return NULL instead of the correct return value. This has been fixed. Fix for real user monitoring when a Content-Length response header is present. When automatic real user monitoring is enabled, the agent will only perform JavaScript injection into HTML pages when a Content-Length header is not already present in the response. In some cases, this check was not working correctly leading to the value in the Content-Length header not matching the actual number of bytes sent to the client. Fixed a segmentation fault when Zend Thread Safety is enabled. Attempts to use the agent under Apache using a threaded MPM (e.g. worker or event) and mod_php would result in segmentation faults. This has been fixed, but New Relic does not recommend  using the agent in these circumstances. Fixed high CPU usage under heavy load Under very high loads with thousands of PHP processes, the background daemon process could consume 100% CPU when the per-process file descriptor limit was exceeded. This has been fixed. The agent will now throttle the number of new connections accepted when per-process file descriptor limit is reached. A message is also printed to the log file.",

New Features Support for the Predis library The PHP agent now supports the Predis library. Users of this library will see new metrics in the Database tab, nodes in transaction traces, and breakdown metrics on individual transaction pages. Pipelining multiple commands will result in those commands being grouped and treated as a single command metric named pipeline. Note that our Predis support does not include instrumentation for commands wrapped in MULTI and EXEC via the Predis client's transaction method. We also do not instrument the executeRaw or monitor methods of Predis, nor its PubSub functionality. Increased specificity of PECL Redis metrics Metrics made for the PECL Redis extension will now more closely match the name of the function called. For example, the redis::setex method will now create a metric with the text setex, rather than simply set. Named Laravel Artisan commands Background transactions that are Laravel Artisan commands are now named. Instead of being named unknown, Laravel Artisan commands will now be named based on the command. For instance, the command ./artisan cache:clear will result in a background transaction named Artisan/cache:clear.

New Features Zend Framework 2 transaction naming support Support has been added for naming transactions automatically based on ZF2 route names. Transaction naming will work with routes set in module.config.php, or anything else using the setMatchedRouteName method of Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\RouteMatch (or the same methods of the corresponding HTTP and Console routers). For example: 'router' => array( 'routes' => array( 'route1' => array( ... ) 'route' => '/foo[/:bar][/:baz]', 'constraints' => array( ... ), 'defaults' => array( ... 'route2' => array( ... ) Anything the router matches to route1 will be named route1 regardless of URL, parameters or controller. 404 errors and similar will be named \"unknown\". Silex transaction naming support Support has been added for naming transactions automatically based on Silex controller names. If a route name has been set using the Controller::bind() method, then that will be used, otherwise the default controller name generated by Silex will be used instead. For example: // This will be named with the autogenerated \"GET_hello_name\". $app->get('/hello/{name}', function ($name) { ... }); // This will be named \"hello\", as bound. $app->get('/hello/{name}', function ($name) { ... })->bind('hello'); Automatic transaction naming will work on all Silex 1.x versions provided the default kernel service has not been replaced with an object of a type other than Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\HttpKernel. If the kernel service has been replaced with something else, you will need to continue to use the newrelic_name_transaction function to name your transactions. End of Life Notices memcacheDuration attributes have been removed. A bug in version 4.19 of the PHP agent removed support for memcacheDuration attributes in Transaction events. We have decided not to restore this functionality, as these durations are now accounted for in databaseDuration attribute values. Bug Fixes databaseDuration attributes have been restored. A bug in versions 4.19 and 4.20 of the PHP agent resulted in databaseDuration attributes no longer being attached to Transaction events. These have been restored, with one change: they now also include time spent in Memcached operations, as these are now unified with other datastores in New Relic APM. Fix application name rollup ordering issue. When using application rollup names, the agent had the restriction that any name could only appear as the first rollup name once, which prevented the simultaneous connection of a;b and a;c. This restriction has been removed.",

Starting with Laravel 5.0.15, applications with an optimized classloader use a new location for the optimized \"compiled.php\" file.

Release Unavailable Due to a bug in this release related to the new explain plan support for MySQLi, we have decided to remove it from our download servers. Instead, we recommend installing version 4.20.1 , which includes a fix for this bug. New Features Support for Laravel 5.0. We are pleased to announce support for the latest Laravel release: Laravel 5. Sites and applications using Laravel 5.0 are now automatically detected and named in the same way as Laravel 4 applications. Support for explain plans with MySQLi. The existing support for generating explain plans for slow SELECT queries with the PDO MySQL driver has been extended to MySQLi. Explain plans are controlled by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled  and newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold  settings. These plans can be seen in the query analysis section of the slow SQL trace  page in APM. Explain plans will be generated for queries issued through mysqli_query, mysqli_real_query, and mysqli_stmt_execute, as well as their OO equivalents mysqli::query, mysqli::real_query, and mysqli_stmt::execute. Please note that the mysqli_multi_query API is not currently supported, and that explain plans are not generated for multiple (semicolon separated) queries. Added Memcache connection monitoring. The connect and pconnect functions (and their OO counterparts) of the Memcache extension are now instrumented, and will generate metrics. As a result, if there is a problem with calling those functions, it will now be visible within New Relic. Bug Fixes Laravel 4 App::after() filters are no longer overridden. In certain circumstances, the improved Laravel transaction naming code in version 4.19 of the PHP agent could result in filters registered using Laravel 4's App::after() method no longer being executed. This has been fixed. Upgrade Notices The daemon now uses openssl 1.0.1m, rather than 1.0.1l. The daemon now uses curl 7.41.0 rather than 7.40.0.",

Memcached and Redis time reported separately Previously, the agent grouped Memcached and Redis operations into a single Memcached category. This is no longer the case. Time spent performing Memcached or Redis operations are separate. Bug Fixes Laravel transaction naming improvements Prior to this version, Laravel applications that had replaced the default router service could find that, in some circumstances, their transactions would be named as \"unknown\" rather than being correctly named from the route. This has been improved: replacement router services will now get appropriate transaction naming provided that they either implement filtering or ensure that the same events are fired as the default Laravel router.",

Notes Revert to using a UNIX-domain socket for agent to daemon communication. This is the same mechanism used in the 2.x and 1.x series of agents. This was done for speed purposes. The default socket path is the same as it was for the older versions of the agent: /tmp/.newrelic.sock. The newrelic.daemon.port option in the INI file and the portoption in the daemon configuration file (newrelic.cfg) can now take either a path to a UNIX-domain socket, or an integer in the range 1-65534. If you use a path, then a UNIX-doman socket will be used. If you use an integer, then a TCP socket will be used on the specified port. Correct the \"banner\" displayed in the log file to show the version of the running PHP. Previously it was incorrectly showing the version that we had compiled with. On platforms that support it, now attempt to display a stack dump in the unlikely event that the agent receives a SIGSEGV signal due to a bug. Displaying this stack is not always possible but when it works it is a big help for technical support to diagnose the exact cause of the problem. This feature existed in the 2.x series of agent but was not working correctly in the 3.x series until now. Fixed a problem where a communications failure between the agent and daemon when sending a transaction trace would result in a core dump (rare). Fixed a problem with Memcache metrics using the wrong metric name. Fixed a coredump that would occur when sending SQL tracers that were both un-obfuscated and contained lots of UNICODE characters (very rare). If a SIGSEGV signal is ever received make sure the daemon exits completely so that it can be respawned. Under certain conditions it could become \"stuck\" which would slow down the agent and stop all data from being sent to New Relic.",

Notes This release of the New Relic PHP agent adds two major new features, and includes several important bug fixes and stability improvements. The new features are: Key Transaction Support, and Real User Monitoring improvements. Key transactions (discussed here ) allow you to mark transactions that are important to your specific business needs and can have their own Apdex settings and error metrics. The Real User Monitoring (RUM) improvements allow you to link select transaction traces with browser traces. Other improvements include the ability for RUM to work with multiple application names, and delivery of the RUM JavaScript file will only use the https protocol if the main page was also delivered via https. The new newrelic_set_user_attributes() API call can now also be used to add additional data to browser traces. Please see this page  for details. The following smaller improvements and bug fixes have been made: Fixed an agent segmentation fault that occurred during Slow SQL processing at the end of a transaction. Fixed a daemon segmentation fault that occurred if the agent communication with the daemon was interrupted for any reason. Fixed a memory leak in the agent when the maximum number of Slow SQL statements for a transaction was reached. Fixed an error that was preventing the daemon from re-spawning a copy of itself if the worker daemon died due to a segmentation fault. Updated the newrelic_set_appname API call to no longer send the transaction thus far to the daemon unless you give it an argument explicitly requesting this behavior. This considerably reduces the overhead of changing application names on the fly. Updated the newrelic_end_transaction API call to allow you to decide whether or not the transaction should be sent to the daemon. It is by default. Fixed an error in the installer script where the license key was not being inserted into the INI file correctly. Functions with custom instrumentation (newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom) will now produce metrics that can be used in custom dashboards. If your application produces a Content-Length header, automatic RUM (\"auto-RUM\") will no longer inject the RUM header and footer, which would invalidate the content length calculated by your application. The NR_INSTALL_KEY environment variable is now correctly obeyed. The daemon is now compiled to support showing a backtrace in the event of a segmentation violation.",

For these two frameworks the transaction naming is now more accurate and adds less overhead than the previous mechanism used to name transactions. This also fixed an issue where Magento transaction names sometimes had garbage characters in them or sometimes even PHP script fragments. In both cases the transaction is named 'module/controller/action' as it is for other frameworks. Another very special thank you to Roderick Smyth of Arithon in Dublin for absolutely invaluable help during the beta testing period and for testing the OCI8 support. Significant improvements to automatic Real User Monitoring (auto-RUM). The most important change is that auto-RUM is now implemented as an output filter so it now works for all frameworks, not just Drupal and Wordpress. It is also considerably more reliable as a result, as modules and other changes to the framework no longer impact how we insert the RUM header and footer. If you previous had to manually insert RUM headers and footers, you are strongly encouraged to re-enable auto-RUM and comment out your existing manual calls. To go with this change there is a new API call, 'newrelic_disable_autorum()' that you can call to prevent auto-RUM from running for a given transaction. For example you may want to disable auto-RUM for AJAX calls. Regardless of how it is invoked, the RUM footer will now never be ejected if the header was not also ejected in the same transaction. This prevents JavaScript errors if the header somehow fails to get inserted. The RUM header and footer have been very slightly modified to add a missing semicolon after the last script command. This also prevents some browsers and compliance analyzers from complaining about the JavaScript. Support for the MemCache-like features of Redis has been added. This is by no means full support for Redis, just those portions of the Redis API that map cleanly onto the existing MemCache metrics. They will show up in the overview graphs as MemCache activity, so if you use both MemCache and Redis the data will be merged, just as the overview for different SQL databases is merged. Considerably improved support for multi-framework sites (where more than one framework is in use for multiple parts of the same site). Instrumentation for framework-specific functions is now isolated on a per-request basis, so multiple requests handled by one PHP instance will no longer be confused by by the sudden change in framework. The logrotate script no longer conflicts with the version installed by the New Relic Server Monitor. Implemented a timeout for agent-to-daemon communication so that if the daemon becomes unresponsive for whatever reason, the agent will no longer hang (and thus appear to crash Apache) waiting for the daemon to recover. Correctly ignore user notice errors in the error handler. Added support for the deprecated but still frequently used mysql_db_query function. Added support for the Zend framework's Zend_Http_Client::request() method to track external service calls better in Zend. Added the ability to use the syntax newrelic.appname=\"%{VARIABLE}\"when setting the application name. This will use the SAPI's environment variable lookup mechanism to find VARIABLE and set the application name accordingly. The REPLACE SQL command verb will now be recognized and unique metrics generated for it rather than being lumped into \"other\". A thread mutex deadlock issue on OpenSolaris has been resolved. Support for the pure PHP MemCached client from Wikia has been added. file_get_contents() now shows up in the external services tab if the object being retrieved is remote and uses HTTP or HTTPS. The newrelic_notice_error() now has a third invocation form, which takes a string and an Exception object. If the string is provided it is used as the error message. If it is empty then a default string in a format similar to Exception::__toString() is automatically generated and used as the error message. The exception object provided will be used to create the stack trace for the exception so that you can see the stack trace at the time of the exception, rather than the stack trace at the time of displaying the exception. If you enable the capturing of request parameters by setting newrelic.capture_params = true, you can now also set newrelic.ignored_params to a comma-separated list of sensitive parame…",

Notes: Version number change. Starting with this release version numbers only use 2 segments, as in 2.3. The remaining bits simply reflect the build level. Naming web transactions for several new frameworks has been added: Joomla (1.5 and 1.6), Kohana (3.1 and 3.2), Magento 1.6 and MediaWiki 1.16. Drupal auto-RUM has been modified to inject the header earlier so that all CSS and JavaScript loading is taken into account, and it now also works when the advagg module is installed. Drupal modules support. This needs to be enabled by setting newrelic.framework.drupal.modules=1. This will display how much time is being spent in each Drupal module, including sub-modules. When enabled this feature is accessed from the \"Modules\" tab of the App Server menu. Support for MongoDB has been added. New API call newrelic_ignore_apdex() has been added. This allows users to ignore certain time-consuming activities (such as downloading a file) from their overall apdex score. PHP namespace separator () no longer causes a malformed JSON error when it appears in a transaction trace. SQL parser improved to better detect table names and avoid database metric explosion on certain SQL statements. Calls to Drupal's drupal_http_request()are now correctly identified as external service calls. Several speed improvements to further reduce the impact when Drupal Modules support or top100 is enabled. MacOSX agent no longer aborts when PCRE isn't loaded. RUM scripts improved to load the footer script after the page has fully loaded so that it does not impact user-visible performance. API functions newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() and newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() now take an optional bool argument (that defaults to true) that indicates whether or not script start and end tags should be inserted around the returned JavaScript. Small memory leak when adding metric names fixed. Daemon startup scripts now correctly ignores comment lines",

    "description": "Download this agent version New features and improvements Added support for Webflux 6 1181 Added support for Spring JMS 6 1088 Added support for Mongodb Reactive Streams 1164 Added support for Kafka Streams 1170 Support for Kafka Streams comes in two flavors, metrics and spans. Metrics are enabled by default, while spans are disabled by default. To enable spans add the following to your newrelic.yml  configuration under the common section: Error fingerprint - supply your own errors inbox group names 1195 Are your error occurrences grouped poorly? Set your own error fingerprint via a callback function. A new public API method has been added that will accept a user defined proc. The proc will be invoked for each noticed error and whenever it returns a string, that string will be used as the error group name for the error and will take precedence over any server-side grouping that takes place with the New Relic errors inbox. This gives users much greater control over the grouping of their errors. For more information check our API: Error Grouping  and APM: Group errors tab  pages. User tracking - associate errors with a user id 1188 You can now see the number of users impacted by an error group. Identify the end user with a new public API method that will accept a string representation of a user id and associate that user id with the current transaction. Transactions and errors will then have a new enduser.id agent attribute associated with them. This will allow agent users to tag transactions and errors as belonging to given user ids in support of greater filtering and alerting capabilities. For more information check the [Newrelic.setUserId ](https://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/com/newrelic/api/agent/NewRelic.html#setUserName(java.lang.String)  documentation and the Track users impacted with errors inbox  page.

Update to latest version [#procedures] To identify which version of the Java agent you're currently using, run java -jar newrelic.jar -v. Your Java agent version will be printed to your console. Then, to update to the latest Java agent version: Back up the entire  Java agent root directory  to another location. Rename that directory to NewRelic_Agent#.#.#, where #.#.# is the agent version number. Download the agent. Unzip the new agent download file, then copy newrelic-api.jar and newrelic.jar into the original Java agent root directory . Compare your old newrelic.yml with the newly downloaded newrelic.yml from the zip, and update the file if needed . Restart your Java dispatcher. If you experience issues after the Java agent update, restore from the backed-up New Relic agent directory. Update agent config differences [#diff] We add new settings to newrelic.yml as we release new versions of the agent. You can use diff or another diffing utility to see what's changed, and add the new config settings to your old file. Make sure not to overwrite any customizations you've made to the file, such as your license key, app name, or changes to default settings. For example, if you diff the default newrelic.yml files for Java agent versions 7.7.0 and 7.8.0, the results printed to the console will be: In this example, these lines were added to the default newrelic.yml in Java agent version 7.8.0.

Therefore, this version of the agent is not compatible with Java 7 and is only recommended if you are using Java 8+ and are otherwise unable to upgrade to Java agent 7.4.1. Mitigation for Java 7 Java agent versions 4.12.0 through 6.5.0 (which support Java 7) use Log4j 2.11.2  which falls into the affected range. For Java 7 users the recommended mitigation from Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities  is to set the system property -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true. Mitigation: In releases 2.10, this behavior can be mitigated by setting the system property log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups. For releases 2.7 and 2.14.1, all PatternLayout patterns can be modified to specify the message converter as %m{nolookups} instead of just %m. For releases 2.0-beta9 and 2.10.0, the mitigation is to remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class Note : The alternate approach of defining the LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true environment variable will not work with the NR Java Agent.

New Features and Improvements: Spring Webflux/Netty Reactor instrumentation improvements for enhanced tracing across asynchronous thread hops.

Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers)  is used to create and insert distributed tracing headers (both newrelic and W3C Trace Context) into a Headers data structure. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers)  is used to accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace.

AWS Async SDK AWS S3 - The Java agent now reports calls to Amazon S3 using the S3AsyncClient as external metrics AWS SQS - The Java agent now reports calls to SqsAsyncClient as message queue metrics AWS SNS - The Java agent now reports calls to Amazon SQS using SNSAsyncClient as message queue metrics Fixes In an effort to modernize our language and improve clarity, we have renamed several config values. The old names will still work for now, but they will all be removed in the next major version. transaction_tracer.slow_query_whitelist is now transaction_tracer.collect_slow_queries_from strip_exception_messages.whitelist is now strip_exception_messages.allowed_classes command_parser.blacklist is now command_parser.disallow The strip_exception_messages config now excludes nested exception messages The agent will now use a lightweight tracer for SQL tracers beyond the segment_limit , improving performance in cases with a high number of segments. The agent would fail to report the Docker containerId for some combinations of systemd and Kubernetes The agent logger would fail to log with: “ERROR RollingFileAppender 'File': No TriggeringPolicy provided” when newrelic.config.log_file_count>1 and newrelic.config.isDaily=false and newrelic.config.log_limit_bytes=0 Known issues and workarounds If a .NET agent is initiating distributed traces as the root service, you must update that .NET agent to version 8.24 or later before upgrading your downstream Java New Relic agents to this agent release.",

The agent will now capture outbound http calls made with the spray-can client and report them as external calls  and/or distributed traces . Embedded Derby 10.15.1.3 The Java agent has expanded support for Derby JDBC up to and including version 10.15.1.3. JVM monitoring The Java agent now reports JMX stats for off-heap direct byte buffers. These metrics are available via the JVM page recordCustomEvent API The recordCustomEvent API has been updated to accept Map<String,?> as a second parameter instead of Map<String,Object>, allowing maps such as Map<String,String> to be passed without having to cast the type of the map's value.

    "description": "Download this agent version Improvements Kafka-clients The Java agent now supports the kafka-clients library. The agent will automatically report up Kafka metrics to New Relic. Optional support is provided for reporting Kafka metrics as Insights events and for enabling distributed tracing. More information can be found in the New Relic documentation . Java 12, Coretto and Zulu The New Relic Java agent is now fully compatible with Java 12. This release also adds support for the Amazon Coretto and Azul Zulu JDKs. New APIs Added ignoreErrors()  to the Transaction API, allowing all errors reported within a specific transaction to be ignored. Added addCustomParameters(Map<String, Object>)  API, allowing multiple custom parameters to be added to a transaction at once. Updated the noticeError()  API documentation to clarify that when the api is invoked multiple times while in a transaction, only the first error will be reported. Deprecated APIs The custom transport channel API is now deprecated in favor of the Distributed Tracing  API. The skipTransactionTrace attribute on the @Trace annotation is now deprecated. The excludeFromTransactionTrace  attribute should be used in its place. Deprecated Instrumentation JetS3t Removed built-in instrumentation for JetS3t. The agent will continue to report external calls made with the JetS3t client. Fixes Fixed an issue with Jax-RS subresource transaction naming where the root path is duplicated when a nested resource structure is used. This could lead to transactions being named incorrectly for incoming requests to a Jax-RS framework. Fixed a bug in the agent's Jetty metric sampling that could prevent Jetty specific metrics from being reported when the number of threads returned by JMX is zero. Fixed a NullPointerException that can occur when cross application tracing configuration is explicitly disabled. Fixed an issue where transactions would be named incorrectly when using custom Akka Http stream directives or a pathEnd directive followed by a Segment directive.

The agent will also time web handlers, track async handlers, and external calls made with Vert.x HTTP client. Wildfly 12-15 The agent now supports Wildfly versions 12 through 15. Fixes: Fixed an issue where applications using neo4j bolt JDBC driver could fail to start. The log_daily configuration did not respect documented precedence. Fixed a bug that caused the Spring Webflux instrumentation to fail to apply for spring-webflux versions greater than 5.0.*. Fixed an issue where transactions would not be fully reported if distributed_tracing.enabled = true and cross_application_tracer.enabled = false. Fixed an issue where Akka Http application would not start with the agent attached when using sbt. Fixed an issue where the agent could fail to determine the hostname . Known Issues Fixes in 4.12.0 Fixed an issue with Jax-RS subresource transaction naming where the root path is duplicated when a nested resource structure is used. This could lead to transactions being named incorrectly for incoming requests to a Jax-RS framework. Fixed a bug in the agent's Jetty metric sampling that could prevent Jetty specific metrics from being reported when the number of threads returned by JMX is zero.

Fixed an issue where transactions would be named incorrectly when using custom Akka Http stream directives or a pathEnd directive followed by a Segment directive. Fixed an issue where certain usages of Akka and Scala would prevent transactions from being reported to New Relic. This would also manifest as a NullPointerException in the agent log at finest level. The Java agent no longer includes Jaxb or Logback dependencies. A new dependency on Log4j2 has been added. Fixes in 4.12.1 Fixed an issue where an exception would be thrown during agent initialization which caused the application to shut down when the log file is not writable. In previous agent versions there was an undocumented behavior where the agent would log to STDOUT instead. Fixed a regression where a NullPointerException would be logged and instrumentation would not be applied when using an XML extension with comments preceding the instrumentation section. Fixed issue where setting the log_limit_in_kbytes greater than 0 and log_file_count equal to 1 would result in the agent not logging to the agent log file. Fixes in 5.0.0 The agent no longer requires a newrelic.yml even when the 'app_name' and 'license_key' configuration options are set via environment variables and/or system properties. For more details, see [Java agent configuration(]https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agen... ). HttpSessions JMX metrics were not reporting for Websphere Liberty Profile applications. The transaction_events.max_samples_stored configuration value in the newrelic.yml would incorrectly override the system properties or environment variable values Applications running on Wildfly 12 - 15 would fail start with NoClassDefFound errors for Java agent classes. Play applications where external calls inside of future callbacks using async-http-client would not be recorded. Setting log_limit_in_kbytes would result in the agent not logging to the agent log file if log_file_count was also set to less than 2. Webflux status codes which were not recognized by Spring Webflux caused a 500 status code to be returned and an exception in application logs. Fixes in 5.1.0 Fixed an issue in the Scala instrumentation that would cause an Java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: to be thrown when the Lightbend Cinnamon agent is in use. Fixed issue where cross application tracing headers  were incorrectly parsed when distributed tracing  is enabled. Applications that use both distributed tracing and cross application tracing will no longer report external transaction breakdown metrics. Fixed an issue where the agent’s Kafka instrumentation would report WakeupExceptions as errors in New Relic. These exceptions will no longer be reported. Fixed a Log4J ClassCastException for applications running on the IBM J9 JVM that set a custom logging manager via the -Djava.util.logging.manager system parameter. The agent now supports using the thread profiler  when the send_environment_info configuration  is disabled. Fixes in 5.2.0 Fixed an issue where very long-running transactions with a large number of segments  would cause an excessive amount of memory usage.

Fix: RESTEasy transactions In certain instances, transactions between applications were not getting linked correctly when RESTEasy was used. Fix: JBoss 7 port not reported correctly The port was not reported correctly for some JBoss users. Fix: Auto-RUM bug Starting in version 3.5.0 of the Java agent, in rare cases Auto-RUM could cause the New Relic footer script to be placed within a script tag. Fix: Errors not reporting with some versions WebSphere 7.0 In some Fix Packs of WebSphere 7.0, the agent did not report errors properly. Fix: Agent works properly inside a folder with + in the path The Java agent did not initialize properly when in a folder with a + character in the pathname. Fix: Agent HttpClient logging The Agent's HttpClient was writing to the app server's log when it discovered a log4j appender. Fix: Inconsistent State with Play 1.2.x In some cases the agent was logging an \"Inconsistent state!\" message and not reporting a transaction. Fix: Invalid errors for Stripes The Agent was erroneously reporting spurious 404 errors for web apps using Stripes. Fix: Hanging threads in the Agent with SQL Prepared Statements Under rare circumstances, threads could hang in the Agent when an application with multiple threads made heavy use of SQL Prepared Statements. Fix: Request queue time was incorrect for some versions of nginx Nginx fractional second header values for queue and server start times are now parsed correctly. Fix: XML entity expansion with non-SSL connection to New Relic Fixed an XML entity expansion vulnerability that only occurs when the agent is configured with ssl: false; the default is true. The agent already has other protection against unauthorized entity expansion. This fix is an additional layer of protection. Fix: In rare case, agent can cause application thread to hang Under rare circumstances, an application thread could hang when an application with multiple threads made heavy use of SQL Prepared Statements.",

In this case, the agent logged a java.lang.StackOverflowError Fixes in 4.1.0 Ensure that custom events added during a transaction do not get discarded if the transaction is ignored via a call to NewRelic.ignoreTransaction(). A security update that corrects an issue affecting PostgreSQL that could occur if High-security mode was enabled (or record_sql was set to off) and a query ran slow enough to trigger an explain plan. If the above conditions were met the agent may not have properly stripped out all information from the query. For information on this fix, see the security bulletin. Fixes an issue where the agent could not parse database statements that included the IGNORE and INTO keywords. Fixes in 4.2.0 Fixes a bug where transactions were being kept alive for too long when application is under heavy GC, causing inaccurate throughput to be reported. Fixes a bug in which Akka routing instrumentation could cause extra memory usage. When this is the case, the transaction throughput will look significantly lower than anticipated. Fixes a rare bug in Play WS instrumentation where exceptions thrown by instrumentation were propagated out to the application code, potentially causing the request to error. Fixes a bug where Jersey Client and HttpUrlConnection could be double instrumented, resulting in inflated external call count. Fixes a bug where the total time and response time for a long running task could be misreported. Fixes in 4.3.0 Fixes an issue where transaction throughput counts could be artificially inflated when using async servlets in Jersey. Fixes an issue where JBoss and Wildfly datasources could cause a LinkageError. Fixes in 4.4.0 Fixes an issue where the Java agent 4.3.0 would not report data depending on the locale setting of the JVM. Java Agent 4.3.0 failed to send event data if the JVM locale is set to use a comma as the decimal. You would see NumberFormatException in the agent log. Fixes a rare issue where the agent will incorrectly attempt to continually retransform classes when an extension with a modification date in the future is used, causing a significant increase in CPU load. Fixes a ConcurrentModificationException caused by ning instrumentation that manifests in Mule instrumentation that causes the request it affects to be retried and the Java agent to not report header data. Fixes an issue where if enable_auto_app_naming was set to true and distributed_tracing.enabled was set to true it would sample every distributed trace event. Now if the agent has both configs enabled, it will not turn on distributed tracing. Fixes in 4.5.0 Fixes an issue where OKHttp 3 was not tracking external total time correctly. Fixes an issue where for some JDBC drivers, the agent would execute additional getMetaData queries.. Fixes an issue with the agent’s Scala instrumentation that could result in incorrect throughput, invalid or negative data in transaction segments, or inability to ignore status codes. Fixes an issue with the play-ws instrumentation that caused ClassNotFound exceptions to occur in the agent logs when withHeaders is used. This could result incomplete transactions and attributes in RPM. Fixes in 4.6.0 Fixes an issue where the agent could cause an application deadlock when two tokens are created and linked from the other’s thread. This affects users of the New Relic token API and also users of the Hystrix framework. Fixes an issue where the agent would not capture JMX Datasource information from Tomcat when JDNI GlobalNamingResources is used. Fixes in 4.7.0 None Fixes in 4.8.0 Fixed an issue where the agent would break webpage rendering by inserting New Relic Browser monitoring javascript into the <header> tag of pages which were missing <head> tags. Certain frameworks, like Spring Cloud Gateway, triggered a bug in the Spring webflux instrumentation, causing transactions to stay open until they timed out. This bug resulted in more memory pressure and looked like a memory leak. This has been fixed in this release.

Please use version 3.44.1  instead. Improvements Supports Play 2.6, Akka HTTP 10, and Scala 2.12. The agent now provides instrumentation for Play 2.6.x. It also provides instrumentation for Akka HTTP 10. It supports Scala 2.12.x, so Play and Akka HTTP transactions show full detail, including async activity using Scala Promises and Futures. Lowers overhead for Play, Akka, and Scala. This agent release imposes lower overhead for applications that use Play, Akka, and Scala. The reduction in overhead will be most notable in lightweight applications and microservices. Unlike previous versions of the agent, by default the agent will not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures will not contribute to the transaction’s reported Total Time. For most customers, this change will provide more concise information in transaction trace details, with no loss of insight. If those segments are valuable to you, and you are willing to incur higher overhead, you can enable that instrumentation with the following setting: Bug Fixes The 3.43.0 version of the agent caused Tomcat to report a ClassFormatException error at startup.

Slick With this release, the Java agent now supports Slick 3.2 API Added ExtendedRequest API class to report content-length for HTTP responses. See Transaction.setWebResponse API  for more details. Bug fixes Fixed bug in Netty instrumentation that cause erroneous reporting of NettyDispatcher transactions. This affected transactions responding large incoming requests. Fixed bug that caused agent to not report error rate metrics. The UI would show application errors, but error rate would show up as 0%. This was introduced in 3.38.0.",

New Relic now shows transactions initiated via JMS 1.1 message receipt. These transactions show up in the New Relic UI as background tasks of type \"Message\". In addition, JMS 1.1 message creation is shown in transaction traces. Grails 1.3.7 to 2.3.x New Relic now provides first-class visibility into your Grails applications. Grails web transactions are now named based on the Grails controller. The transactions track the details of your calls to JDBC, Hibernate, and other important frameworks, and provides full access to the New Relic Java agent API from Groovy. Grails installation instructions can be found here Updated instrumentation for supported app servers New Relic has updated the instrumentation of the application servers we support. In the process, we have updated the list of app servers that we instrument.

    "description": "Download this agent version Improvements Play Framework 2.4 Instrumentation, and Play Framework 2 Improvements Previous Java Agent releases supported the Play Framework up to version 2.3. This release includes instrumentation for Play 2.4.x. This release provides more insight than ever before for all versions of Play 2, including improved segment names, and better signal-to-noise ratio in transaction details. This instrumentation also takes advantage of the new response time line  in the New Relic UI. Because Play is a reactive framework that encourages concurrent activity, your total time for transaction components will often be greater than the response time. If the total time is less than response time, it may indicate resource exhaustion. By separating the total time from the response time, you get a clear picture of when you are getting the benefit of concurrency. If you have used the Java Agent to monitor Play before this release, you may see a decrease in response time. The new response time metric more accurately reflects the time from initial request to response. We support Play applications written in Java or Scala 2.9.3 - 2.11.x. Note:  The deprecated -Dnewrelic.bootstrap_classpath system property can result in missing instrumentation and should not be used. Netty 3.4 - 4.x Instrumentation This release updates our Netty support to include versions from 3.4 to 4.x. Previous release supported up to Netty 3.9. The agent will start transactions for server inbound I/O. The agent will instrument Netty HTTP methods to enable cross application tracing (CAT) in Netty transactions. AsyncHttpClient Instrumentation 1.0.2 - 1.9.x In this release, you will see the time spent in external service calls made using AsyncHttpClient (also known as Ning Http Client). If the external service is also running New Relic, you will see cross application tracing (CAT) details as well. This includes external calls made from Play WSAPI, which uses AsyncHttpClient. Note:  As in previous releases, Play 1 applications will not report AsyncHttpClient activity. Akka Instrumentation 2.0 - 2.4 This release enhances our Akka instrumentation by linking an actor message sender to an actor message receiver in the same transaction. In order to avoid over-instrumentation, our Akka instrumentation does not actually start transactions. If you would like a given actor call to mark the beginning of a transaction, you will need to use the @Trace(dispatcher=true) annotation , or some other form of custom instrumentation . Notes: This release supports core Akka, not all Akka extensions. In particular, it does not identify transactions that have been routed by Spray, Akka HTTP, or Akka Streams. We have heard from customers that these frameworks are important, and we expect to support them soon! Stay tuned to the Java agent incubator , since we may provide an early access instrumentation module for these frameworks before we release them in the agent. Known Issues: If your application uses AsyncHttpClient's WebSockets, do not use this version.  AsyncHttpClient WebSockets requests will fail, or the application will not start. In some cases, calls to NewRelic's getBrowserTimingHeader and getBrowserTimingFooter are ignored.",

In some cases JAX-RS annotations on interfaces are not observed, causing transactions using JAX-RS services to be named on the servlet rather than the web servicepath and method. Fixed in 3.24.1: The Java agent's Play 2 transaction tracing instrumentation may be incomplete and cause gaps in cross application tracing. Fixed in 3.24.0: The Java agent's EJB instrumentation may cause a StackOverflowException to appear in application logs. Applications may continue to experience the additional Circuit Breaker overhead even when disabled. The Java agent may experience increased overhead when using Cross Application Tracing and a large number of threads. Fixed in 3.23.0 This release may experience a memory leak within the agent for Tomcat containing a large number of static JSPs (5000+).

Notes Glassfish 4 metrics for JVM Memory, Thread Pool, and Transactions New Relic now displays JVM memory, thread pool, and transaction metrics for Glassfish 4. To expose these metrics, please set http-service, transaction- service, and web-container monitoring within Glassfish to high. To see the metrics in New Relic, go to Monitoring > JVMs. Decreased agent overhead for Play 2 This version of the agent reduces the overhead that it incurs on Play 2. Play 2 users should upgrade for improved performance. In addition to general overhead improvements, New Relic has introduced a new setting to reduce overhead even more for particularly low-latency applications. Note that this setting will make the call info in Trace Details more generic. Manually disable auto RUM instrumentation for specific pages For supported JSP engines, New Relic automatically adds RUM (Real User Monitoring) elements to the response HTML. If you like auto-RUM, but do not want to apply it to all pages, you can now disable it for select pages. The configuration property disabled_auto_pages in the browser_monitoring section can now be used to disable auto RUM instrumentation for a comma delimited list of pages. For example, akka.actor.ActorKilledException is now ignored by default The ActorKilledException is commonly thrown in Play applications as a control mechanism in normally functioning applications. In previous versions, this exception inflated the reported error rate. These exceptions are now ingored by default. You can override the default ignore_errors list to provide your own exceptions or to omit the ActorKilledException. New Relic reports host capacity information New Relic now reports physical CPU cores, logical CPU cores (hyperthreads), and physical memory. On non-Linux platforms, the agent runs a subprocess to retrieve this information. To see the info in New Relic, go to Settings > Environment > Environment Snapshot. Report JVM name and revision to New Relic as part of JVM description Recording the JVM name in addition to the vendor allows differentiation between different JVMs from the same vendor. To see these values in New Relic, go to Settings > Environment > Environment Snapshot and look for the \"Java VM\" and \"Java VM Version\" settings.

    "description": "Download this agent version Improvements Websphere Liberty Profile The Java agent now provides instrumentation for WebSphere Liberty Profile . This includes web transaction visibility, Cross Application Tracing, and app server stats. Performance improvements The Java agent now starts more quickly so applications are available sooner. This release also reduces agent overhead at run time. Customize hostname displayed in APM A new configuration setting has been added: process_host.display_name . When set in the newrelic.yml  configuration file, the display name identifies the host in the APM UI , along with the hostname that the agent automatically captures. In addition, the display name can be set using the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable. This property can be viewed in all Insights transaction events. WebLogic and WebSphere instance name available The instance name for WebLogic and WebSphere application servers is now available in transaction traces, traced errors, and Insights transaction events. Custom instrumentation of transaction attributes is disabled by default Custom attributes defined using the Instrumentation  tab in the UI are now disabled by default. In order to enable these attributes, you must have High-security mode disabled and you must place the following text in the common: block of your newrelic.yml : Fixes Very large thread profiles were failing to report to RPM, causing the site to display a time out message. The agent will now truncate the size of the profile before sending. Cross application tracing date was failing to report when using Jersey 2 endpoints. Spring AOP instrumentation is now disabled by default. It was exercising a bug in certain versions of Java 8 that caused the JVM to crash.

Cross Application Tracing API Use the cross application tracing API when the agent does not provide cross application tracing support for your application. See the documentation Play 2 Framework Improved instrumentation for Play controller classes. Circuit Breaker Starting in this release, the New Relic Java agent detects when memory is nearly exhausted and trips a “circuit breaker” that limits the agent’s memory usage. The agent won’t report transactions while the circuit breaker is tripped, so throughput will be understated. In the rare case that the circuit breaker trips, the New Relic UI will provide more information. For more details, see the documentation . Added configuration to disable Deadlock Detection Under very heavy load conditions with many threads, the Deadlock Detector service may slow response time. You can now disable this feature with the following setting: Reduced the memory overhead of the Java agent Fixes: Play 2 Framework The Java Agent now honors the segment_limit setting for async traces, and can now handle much deeper async traces.

When you use synthetic monitoring to monitor your Java application, up to 20 detailed transaction traces will now be captured every minute when the application is probed from synthetics. To learn more about this feature, visit our documentation EJB Session Beans The Java agent now monitors Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) 3.0 session beans. The agent instruments @Stateless and @Stateful EJBs, and those that extend java.ejb.SessionBean. The agent traces methods declared by corresponding interfaces annotated with @Remote and @Local. Unified view for SQL database and NoSQL datastore products. The response time charts in the application overview page will now include NoSQL datastores, such as Cassandra and MongoDB,and also the product name of existing SQL databases such as MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, etc. For existing SQL databases, in addition to the existing breakdown of SQL statements and operations, the queries are now also associated with the database product being used. For NoSQL datastores, such as Cassandra and MongoDB, we have now added information about operations performed against those products, similar to what is being done for SQL databases. This new unified Databases page will enable the filtering of metrics and operations by product, and includes a table listing all operations. Because this introduces a notable change to how SQL database metrics are collected, it is important that you upgrade the agent version on all hosts.If you are unable to transition to the latest agent version on all hosts at the same time, you can still access old and new metric data for SQL databases, but the information will be split across two separate views. Datastax Cassandra client Added support for the Datastax Cassandra client versions 2.1.2 or higher. This will include breakdowns in the overview chart, entries in the Databases tab, and segments in transaction traces. Note: uses of the client's async API will not be captured in transaction traces. MongoDB client Added support for MongoDB client versions 2.12.0 up to but not including 3.0+. This will include breakdowns in the overview chart, entries in the Databases tab, and segments in transaction traces. API Reported Errors API reported errors can now be prioritized on a transaction over tracer reported errors. Add the following config to allow prioritizing: Fixes: The Java Agent may now capture traces for transactions that resulted in an error (4xx or 5xx response code). Prior to this release, the agent would only capture traces for successful responses. Updated default newrelic.yml to use transaction_events.max_samples_stored instead of deprecated analytics_events.max_samples_stored property.

    "description": "Download this agent version Improvements Full support for Java SE 8 The New Relic Java agent now supports Java SE 8! Applications can now run on a Java 8 JVM, including those compiled to target Java 8 (i.e. -target 1.8). The system property newrelic.enable.java.8 is no longer necessary. @RequestMapping annotation used to name web transactions Where available, Spring Web Transactions are now named using the URI path pattern defined in the @RequestMapping annotation. This generally provides even more meaningful transaction names than controller methods. To disable this and revert back to naming using controllers, add this config to your newrelic.yml: WebSphere JMX metrics reported when global security is enabled Prior to this version, JMX metrics could not be pulled by the agent with WebSphere when global security was enabled. This means custom JMX metrics in a yaml file and default JMX metrics displayed on the JVM Threads and Http Sessions tabs were not reported. Servlet UserPrincipal name can be reported as an attribute With this release, you can enable the capturing of the UserPrincipal name so that it is available in New Relic and as a transaction trace attribute. To enable: Non-Web Transactions can now be made Key Transactions with a custom apdex T This feature will be available in the RPM UI very soon. It requires this or a higher version of the agent. Fixes Fix: Web transactions not always reported. In some unusual cases the Agent stopped reporting web transactions. The agent would log an error that included the phrase \"Inconsistent state\" Fix: WebSphere 7 reports active thread count on the JVM tab The thread pool active count being displayed in the UI was actually the pool size.

Unless you are a Java SE5 user, use the latest version of the New Relic Java agent. Fixed an issue that in rare cases could cause the agent to cease reporting data until JVM restart. Known issues X-ray sessions sometimes return no transaction traces. Many x-ray session runs can cause a memory leak. Play framework Higher overhead with Play 2 than later releases. Does not work properly with Play 2.2 Counts akka.actor.ActorKilledException as an error. Play transaction does not complete until timeout expires When using Play, ignoreTransaction call does not take effect In some cases running Weblogic, the Java agent fails certificate validation when connecting to New Relic. This may require a workaround . This release contains some inconsistencies in the instrumentation of Hibernate across versions. This release requires a workaround  to use SSL with WebSphere. Potential memory leak when app continually creates ClassLoaders. Rare memory leak if agent does not report to New Relic for an extended period. When running IBM JVM without WebSphere, you must set the sync_startup flag set to true in the common section of newrelic.yml: sync_startup: true. Workaround If you require a workaround for one of these issues, please open a ticket at support.newrelic.com .",

PostgreSQL explain plan bug There was a PostgreSQL bug that allowed parameters to be sent in explain plans under some circumstances. To avoid this issue, the New Relic agent now does not report explain plans for PostgreSQL. Agent no longer supports obfuscation of individual fields Previous versions of the agent allowed an obfuscated_sql_fields option to select specific field names to obfuscate when record_sql: raw. We have discovered rare cases in which this feature would not mask SQL parameters correctly, so we have removed the configuration option. Now, if obfuscated_sql_fields is set, the setting of record_sql: raw is ignored and _all_ fields are masked. Fix: SQL parameter obfuscation didn't work if the parameter value contained a newline The record_sql: obfuscated config setting did not properly mask parameters when it included a newline character. This bug has been fixed. Fix: Private trust store location for use_private_ssl flag The 2.21.4 agent did not properly load a private trust store used with the use_private_ssl flag.

Fix: Spring exception handling The Exception argument in the Spring DispatcherServlet processHandlerException method was reported as an Error with an HTTP status code of 500. The actual status code in the HTTP response is now reported.

Fix: JVM Tab Metrics Not Showing up for Tomcat Applications Prior to this fix, if the service name in service.xml was not Catalina, then metrics would not appear under the JVM tab. Additionally, if you are using an embedded Tomcat 5/6, metrics should now appear under the JVM tab. Fix: Improved compatibility with Java 1.5 In the custom xml validator, there were references to String.isEmpty() which was not available until Java 1.6. Those have been removed.

Notes Cross Application Tracing The Cross Application Tracing feature adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries to provided better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents (Java, .NET, and Ruby, with others coming soon). The 2.14.0 release links aggregated data across applications. This release also links transaction traces. The configuration setting introduced in 2.14.0 to enable/disable Cross Application Tracing in newrelic.yml has changed. The old setting: 'cross_application_tracing: true' is deprecated. The new setting is cross_application_tracer:   enabled: true The default setting is true. Set to false to disable Cross Application Tracing. Instrumentation added for the AmazonS3Client version 1.x The New Relic Agent now offers support for version 1.0 to current of the com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3 interface. New Relic Java Agent support a daily roll over log To roll over the agent log every day, set the property log_daily to true. Set the property log_file_count to the number of day logs you would like to keep. New Relic Java Agent now communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default rather than HTTP If you have an existing installation and wish to use HTTPS to communicate with New Relic, edit your newrelic.yml file to include ssl: true in the common section. We recommend this for existing customers in order to improve the security of your communications with New Relic. Java Agent installer improvements The Java Agent installer now supports JBoss 7.x AS and JBoss 6.x EAP in standalone mode. Instructions for manually installing the Java Agent on JBoss 7.x AS and JBoss 6.x EAP can be found at https://newrelic.com/docs/java/installing-the-java-agent-on-jboss . Fix: Default hostname reported This release reverts the change in 2.14.0 that effected the way that the hostname is reported. With this release, the agent reports the default hostname rather than short form in order to correlate with New Relic server monitoring. Fix: Web transactions naming in Spring MVC version 3.x This bug caused customers using Spring 3.0.1 and above to often have web transactions named by the servlet rather than controller method. This has been fixed such that a separate metric is created for each controller method.",

    "description": "New Features More flexibility for container deployments The daemon and the instrumented application no longer have to reside on the same host and can now communicate over an IPv4 or IPv6 TCP socket. For the instrumented application this can be configured via the daemon_socket argument of the newrelic_init function. For the daemon this can be configured via the --address command line option. When terminating the daemon via the SIGTERM signal (and/or the SIGINT signal if started with the -f, --foreground flag), the daemon will now send all buffered data to New Relic prior to exiting. The daemon has introduced a new configuration --watchdog-foreground. This keeps the daemon watchdog process in the foreground, whereas the --foreground configuration keeps the daemon worker process in the foreground. The new configuration makes it possible to use the daemon in a blocking way, without losing the additional stability provided by the watchdog process. The C SDK now offers newrelic_set_transaction_name with which users may change the name of an already started transaction. Bug Fixes The daemon now synchronously handles critical code paths related to harvesting and merging transaction data. This prevents crashes caused by race conditions. Upgrade Notices The daemon has introduced a new configuration --address which serves as an alias to --port. Customers may use either to specify the location of the daemon. If both values are set, --address takes precedence. When starting the daemon, it will now wait for up to three seconds for the listening port to be ready to receive connections before forking into the background. This usually occurs in (much) less than a second, and most users with this configuration will notice no difference in practice. The time that the daemon will wait can be controlled by setting the --wait-for-port setting with a duration. This duration may be 0 to prevent any blocking. If the option is omitted, the default value is 3s. Daemons started in foreground mode (with the --foreground flag) are unaffected, and will behave as before.",

Infinite Tracing observes 100% of your distributed traces and provides visualizations for the most actionable data so you have the examples of errors and long-running traces so you can better diagnose and troubleshoot your systems. You configure your agent  to send traces to a trace observer in New Relic Edge. You view your distributed traces through the New Relic’s UI. There is no need to install a collector on your network. Infinite Tracing is currently available on a sign-up basis. If you would like to participate, please contact your sales representative. Changes nrgin.Middleware  uses Context.FullPath()  for transaction names when using Gin version 1.5.0 or greater. Gin transactions were formerly named after the Context.HandlerName() , which uses reflection. This change improves transaction naming and reduces overhead. Please note that because your transaction names will change, you may have to update any related dashboards and alerts to match the new name. If you wish to continue using Context.HandlerName() for your transaction names, use nrgin.MiddlewareHandlerTxnNames  instead. Note: As part of agent release v3.4.0, a v2.0.0 tag was added to the nrgin package. When using go modules however, it was impossible to install this latest version of nrgin.

To exclude the error.class and/or error.message attributes from span events, update your agent configuration like so, where cfg is your newrelic.Config  object. Changes Use Context.FullPath()  for transaction names when using Gin version 1.5.0 or greater. Gin transactions were formerly named after the Context.HandlerName() , which uses reflection. This change improves transaction naming and reduces overhead. Please note that because your transaction names will change, you may have to update any related dashboards and alerts to match the new name.",

Distributed Tracing now supports W3C Trace Context headers for HTTP and gRPC protocols when distributed tracing is enabled. Our implementation can accept and emit both W3C trace header format and New Relic trace header format. This simplifies agent upgrades, allowing trace context to be propagated between services with older and newer releases of New Relic agents. W3C trace header format will always be accepted and emitted. New Relic trace header format will be accepted, and you can optionally disable emission of the New Relic trace header format. When distributed tracing is enabled with Config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true, the Go agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling Transaction.AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders . When calling Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders , the Go agent will include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header, unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using Config.DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader = true. Also, see Knowns Issues and Workarounds. Added support for elastic/go-elasticsearch  in the new v3/integrations/nrelasticsearch-v7  package.

Please pay close attention to the list of Changes. Changes A full list of changes and a step by step checklist on how to upgrade can be found in the v3 Migration Guide . New Features Support for Go Modules. Our Go agent integration packages support frameworks and libraries which are changing over time. With support for Go Modules, we are now able to release instrumentation packages for multiple versions of frameworks and libraries with a single agent release; and support operation of the Go agent in Go Modules environments. This affects naming of our integration packages, as described in the v3 Migration Guide (see under \"Changes\" above). Detect and set hostnames based on Heroku dyno names. When deploying an application in Heroku, the hostnames collected will now match the dyno name. This serves to greatly improve the usability of the servers list in APM since dyno names are often sporadic or fleeting in nature. The feature is controlled by two new configuration options Config.Heroku.UseDynoNames and Config.Heroku.DynoNamePrefixesToShorten.",

If your organization has established practices that prevent you from upgrading to the latest version, ensure that your agents are regularly updated to a version that's at most 90 days old. Read more about keeping your agent up to date . 3.37.0 Added Implemented a new approach to integrating New Relic with SLOG that is more lightweight, out of the way, and collects richer data. These changes have been constructed to be completely backwards-compatible with v1 of nrslog. Changes include: Wrapping slog.Handler objects with errors to allow users to handle invalid use cases A complete rework of log enrichment so that New Relic linking metadata does not invalidate JSON, BSON, or YAML scanners. This new approach will instead inject the linking metadata as a key-value pair. Complete support for With(), WithGroup(), and attributes for automatic instrumentation. Performance operations. Robust testing (close to 90% coverage). This updates logcontext-v2/nrslog to v1.4.0. Now custom application tags (labels) may be added to all forwarded log events. Enabled if ConfigAppLogForwardingLabelsEnabled(true) or NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_FORWARDING_LABELS_ENABLED=TRUE May exclude labels named in ConfigAppLogForwardingLabelsExclude(\"label1\",\"label2\",...) or NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_FORWARDING_LABELS_EXCLUDE=\"label1,label2,...\" Labels are defined via ConfigLabels(...) or NEW_RELIC_LABELS Added memory allocation limit detection/response mechanism to facilitate calling custom functions to perform application-specific resource management functionality, report custom metrics or events, or take other appropriate actions, in response to rising heap memory size.

It enables end-to-end visibility into the key components of an AI LLM application. With AI monitoring, users can monitor, alert, and debug AI-powered applications for reliability, latency, performance, security and cost. AI monitoring also enables AI/LLM specific insights (metrics, events, logs and traces) which can easily integrate to build advanced guardrails for enterprise security, privacy and compliance. AI monitoring offers custom-built insights and tracing for the complete lifecycle of an LLM’s prompts and responses, from raw user input to repaired/polished responses. AI monitoring provides built-in integrations with popular LLMs and components of the AI development stack. This release provides instrumentation for OpenAI \nand Bedrock . When AI monitoring is enabled with ConfigAIMonitoringEnabled(true), the agent will now capture AI LLM related data. This data will be visible under a new APM tab called AI Responses. See our AI Monitoring documentation  for more details. Support statement We use the latest version of the Go language.

    "description": "3.20.0 PLEASE READ  these changes, and verify your config settings to ensure your application behaves how you intend it to. This release changes some default behaviors in the go agent. Added The Module Dependency Metrics feature was added. This collects the list of modules imported into your application, to aid in management of your application dependencies, enabling easier vulnerability detection and response, etc. This feature is enabled by default, but may be disabled by explicitly including ConfigModuleDependencyMetricsEnable(false) in your application, or setting the equivalent environment variable or Config field direclty. Modules may be explicitly excluded from the report via the ConfigModuleDependencyMetricsIgnoredPrefixes option. Excluded module names may be redacted via the ConfigModuleDependencyMetricsRedactIgnoredPrefixes option. This is enabled by default. Application Log Forwarding will now be ENABLED  by default Automatic application log forwarding is now enabled by default. This means that logging frameworks wrapped with one of the logcontext-v2 integrations  will automatically send enriched application logs to New Relic with this version of the agent. To learn more about this feature, see the APM logs in context documentation . For additional configuration options, see the Go logs in context documentation . To learn about how to toggle log ingestion on or off by account, see our documentation to disable automatic  logging via the UI or API. If you are using a logcontext-v2 extension, but don't want the agent to automatically forward logs, please configure ConfigAppLogForwardingEnabled(false) in your application. Environment variables have been added for all application logging config options: NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_ENABLED NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_FORWARDING_ENABLED NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_FORWARDING_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_METRICS_ENABLED NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_LOCAL_DECORATING_ENABLED Custom Event Limit Increase This version increases the DEFAULT  limit of custom events from 10,000 events per minute to 30,000 events per minute. In the scenario that custom events were being limited, this change will allow more custom events to be sent to New Relic. There is also a new configurable MAXIMUM  limit of 100,000 events per minute. To change the limits, set ConfigCustomInsightsEventsMaxSamplesStored(limit) to the limit you want in your application. To learn more about the change and how to determine if custom events are being dropped, see our Explorers Hub post . New config option ConfigCustomInsightsEventsEnabled(false) can be used to disable the collection of custom events in your application. Changed Changed the following names to be consistent with their usage and other related identifier names. The old names remain for backward compatibility, but new code should use the new names. ConfigCodeLevelMetricsIgnoredPrefix -> ConfigCodeLevelMetricsIgnoredPrefixes ConfigCodeLevelMetricsPathPrefix -> ConfigCodeLevelMetricsPathPrefixes NEW_RELIC_CODE_LEVEL_METRICS_PATH_PREFIX -> NEW_RELIC_CODE_LEVEL_METRICS_PATH_PREFIXES NEW_RELIC_CODE_LEVEL_METRICS_IGNORED_PREFIX -> NEW_RELIC_CODE_LEVEL_METRICS_IGNORED_PREFIXES When excluding information reported from CodeLevelMetrics via the IgnoredPrefixes or PathPrefixes configuration fields (e.g., by specifying ConfigCodeLevelMetricsIgnoredPrefixes or ConfigCodeLevelMetricsPathPrefixes), the names of the ignored prefixes and the configured path prefixes may now be redacted from the agent configuration information sent to New Relic. This redaction is enabled by default, but may be disabled by supplying a false value to ConfigCodeLevelMetricsRedactPathPrefixes or ConfigCodeLevelMetricsRedactIgnoredPrefixes, or by setting the corresponding Config fields or environment variables to false. Fixed #583 : fixed a bug in zerologWriter where comma separated fields in log message confused the JSON parser and could cause panics.

    "description": "3.18.2 Added Added WithDefaultFunctionLocation trace option. This allows the caller to indicate a fall-back function to use for CLM in case no other location was found first. Added caching versions of the code-level metrics functions ThisCodeLocation and FunctionLocation , and trace options WithThisCodeLocation  and  WithFunctionLocation. These improve performance by caching the result of computing the source code location, and reuse that cached result on all subsequent calls. Added a WithCodeLevelMetrics trace option to force the collection of CLM data even if it would have been excluded as being out of the configured scope. (Note that CLM data are never collected if CLM is turned off globally or if the WithoutCodeLevelMetrics option was specified for the same transaction.) Added an exported CodeLevelMetricsScopeLabelToValue function to convert a list of strings describing CLM scopes in the same manner as the NEW_RELIC_CODE_LEVEL_METRICS_SCOPE environment variable (but as individual string parameters), returning the CodeLevelMetricsScope value which corresponds to that set of scopes. Added a new CodeLevelMetricsScopeLabelListToValue function which takes a comma-separated list of scope names exactly as the NEW_RELIC_CODE_LEVEL_METRICS_SCOPE environment variable does, and returns the CodeLevelMetrics value corresponding to that set of scopes. Added text marshaling and unmarshaling for the CodeLevelMetricsScope value, allowing the CodeLevelMetrics field of the configuration struct to be converted to or from JSON or other text-based encoding representations. Changed The WithPathPrefix trace option now takes any number of string parameters, allowing multiple path prefixes to be recognized rather than just one. The FunctionLocation function now accepts any number of function values instead of just a single one. The first such parameter which indicates a valid function, and for which CLM data are successfully obtained, is the one which will be reported. The configuration struct field PathPrefix is now deprecated with the introduction of a new PathPrefixes field. This allows for multiple path prefixes to be given to the agent instead of only a single one. The NEW_RELIC_CODE_LEVEL_METRICS_SCOPE environment variable now accepts a comma-separated list of pathnames. Fixed Improved the implementation of CLM internals to improve speed, robustness, and thread safety. Corrected the implementation of the WrapHandle and WrapHandleFunc functions so that they consistently report the function being invoked by the http framework, and improved them to use the new caching functions and ensured they are thread-safe. This release fixes issue #557 . Compatibility Notice As of release 3.18.0, the API was extended by allowing custom options to be added to calls to the Application.StartTransaction method and the WrapHandle  and WrapHandleFunc functions.

There is a built-in set of defaults as to which status codes are reported at which severity levels, but this may be overridden by the caller as desired. Also supports custom grpc error handling functions supplied by the user. This is implemented by adding WithStatusHandler() options to the end of the UnaryServerInterceptor() and StreamServerInterceptor() calls, thus extending the capability of those functions while retaining the existing functionality and usage syntax for backward compatibility. Added advice on the recommended usage of the app.WaitForConnection() method. Fixes [https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/issues/296](Issue #296) Added Added a convenience function to build distributed trace header set from a JSON string for use with the AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders() method. Normally, you must create a valid set of HTTP headers representing the trace identification information from the other trace so the new trace will be associated with it. This needs to be in a Go http.Header type value. If working only in Go, this may be just fine as it is. However, if the other trace information came from another source, possibly in a different language or environment, it is often the case that the trace data is already presented to you in the form of a JSON string. This new function, DistributedTraceHeadersFromJSON(), creates the required http.Header value from the JSON string without requiring manual effort on your part. We also provide a new all-in-one method AcceptDistributedTraceHeadersFromJSON() to be used in place of AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders(). It accepts a JSON string rather than an http.Header, adding its trace info to the new transaction in one step.

Server Example Client Example Added new ExternalSegment  fields Host, Procedure, and Library. These optional fields are automatically populated from the segment's URL or Request if unset. Use them if you don't have access to a request or URL but still want useful external metrics, transaction segment attributes, and span attributes. Host is used for external metrics, transaction trace segment names, and span event names. The host of segment's Request or URL is the default. Procedure is used for transaction breakdown metrics. If set, it should be set to the remote procedure being called. The HTTP method of the segment's Request is the default. Library is used for external metrics and the \"component\" span attribute. If set, it should be set to the framework making the call. \"http\" is the default. With the addition of these new fields, external transaction breakdown metrics are changed: External/myhost.com/all will now report as External/myhost.com/http/GET (provided the HTTP method is GET). HTTP Response codes below 100, except 0 and 5, are now recorded as errors. This is to support gRPC status codes. If you start seeing new status code errors that you would like to ignore, add them to Config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes or your server side configuration settings. Improve logrus  support by introducing nrlogrus.Transform , a function which allows you to turn a logrus.Logger  instance into a newrelic.Logger .

    "description": "2.8.0 New Features Support for Real Time Streaming Event data is now sent to New Relic every five seconds, instead of every minute. As a result, transaction, error, and custom events will now be available in New Relic dashboards in near real time. For more information on how to view your events with a five-second refresh, see the real time streaming documentation . Note that the overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute have not changed. Also, span events, metrics, and trace data is unaffected, and will still be sent every minute. Introduce support for databases using database/sql . This new functionality allows you to instrument MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite calls without manually creating DatastoreSegment s. Database Library Supported Integration Package go-sql-driver/mysql _integrations/nrmysql lib/pq _integrations/nrpq mattn/go-sqlite3 _integrations/nrsqlite3 Using these database integration packages is easy! First replace the driver with our integration version: Second, use the ExecContext, QueryContext, and QueryRowContext methods of sql.DB , sql.Conn , sql.Tx , and sql.Stmt  and provide a transaction-containing context. Calls to Exec, Query, and QueryRow do not get instrumented. If you are using a database/sql  database not listed above, you can write your own instrumentation for it using InstrumentSQLConnector , InstrumentSQLDriver , and SQLDriverSegmentBuilder . The integration packages act as examples of how to do this. For more information, see the Go agent documentation on instrumenting datastore segments .

    "description": "2.6.0 New Features Added support for async: the ability to instrument multiple concurrent goroutines, or goroutines that access or manipulate the same Transaction. The new Transaction.NewGoroutine() Transaction method allows transactions to create segments in multiple goroutines! NewGoroutine returns a new reference to the Transaction. This must be called any time you are passing the Transaction to another goroutine which makes segments. Each segment-creating goroutine must have its own Transaction reference. It does not matter if you call this before or after the other goroutine has started. All Transaction methods can be used in any Transaction reference. The Transaction will end when End() is called in any goroutine. Example passing a new Transaction reference directly to another goroutine: Example passing a new Transaction reference on a channel to another goroutine: Added integration support for aws-sdk-go  and aws-sdk-go-v2 . When using these SDKs, a segment will be created for each out going request. For DynamoDB calls, these will be Datastore segments and for all others they will be External segments. v1 Documentation v2 Documentation Added span event and transaction trace segment attribute configuration. You may control which attributes are captured in span events and transaction trace segments using the Config.SpanEvents.Attributes and Config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes settings. For example, if you want to disable the collection of \"db.statement\" in your span events, modify your config like this: To disable the collection of all attributes from your transaction trace segments, modify your config like this: Bug Fixes Fixed a bug that would prevent External Segments from being created under certain error conditions related to Cross Application Tracing. Miscellaneous Improved linking between Cross Application Transaction Traces in the APM UI. When Config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = true, External segments in the Transaction Traces details will now link to the downstream Transaction Trace if there is one. Additionally, the segment name will now include the name of the downstream application and the name of the downstream transaction. Update attribute names of Datastore and External segments on Transaction Traces to be in line with attribute names on Spans. Specifically: \"uri\" => \"http.url\" \"query\" => \"db.statement\" \"database_name\" => \"db.instance\" \"host\" => \"peer.hostname\" \"port_path_or_id\" + \"host\" => \"peer.address\"",

Passing a nil transaction is STRONGLY  recommended when using NewRoundTripper  since it allows one http.Client.Transport to be used for multiple transactions. Example use: Introduced Transaction.SetWebRequest(WebRequest) method which marks the transaction as a web transaction. If the WebRequest parameter is non-nil, SetWebRequest will collect details on request attributes, url, and method. This method is useful if you don't have access to the request at the beginning of the transaction, or if your request is not an *http.Request (just add methods to your request that satisfy WebRequest ). To use an *http.Request as the parameter, use the NewWebRequest  transformation function. Example: Fixed Debug in nrlogrus package. Previous versions of the New Relic Go Agent incorrectly logged to Info level instead of Debug. This has now been fixed. Thanks to @paddycarey for catching this. nrgin.Transaction  may now be called with either a context.Context or a *gin.Context. If you were passing a *gin.Context around your functions as a context.Context, you may access the Transaction by calling either nrgin.Transaction  or FromContext .

    "description": "2.14.0 New Features Added support for a new segment type, MessageProducerSegment , to be used to track time spent adding messages to message queuing systems like RabbitMQ or Kafka. Added new attribute constants for use with message consumer transactions. These attributes can be used to add more detail to a transaction that tracks time spent consuming a message off a message queuing system like RabbitMQ or Kafka. They can be added using txn.AddAttribute . It is recommended that at most one message is consumed per transaction. Added support for Go 1.13's Error wrapping . Transaction.NoticeError now uses Unwrap  recursively to identify the error's cause (the deepest wrapped error) when generating the error's class field. This functionality will help group your errors usefully. For example, when using Go 1.13, the following code: captures an error with message \"problem in alpha: problem in beta: socket error\" and class \"main.socketError\". Previously, the class was recorded as \"*fmt.wrapError\". A Stack field has been added to Error , which can be assigned using the new NewStackTrace  function. This allows your error stack trace to show where the error happened, rather than the location of the NoticeError call. Transaction.NoticeError not only checks for a stack trace (using StackTracer ) in the error parameter, but in the error's cause as well. This means that you can create an Error  where your error occurred, wrap it multiple times to add information, notice it with NoticeError, and still have a useful stack trace. Take a look! In this example, the topmost stack trace frame recorded is \"gamma\", rather than \"execute\". Added support for configuring a maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic. It can be configured as follows: For additional configuration information, see our documentation Miscellaneous Updated the nrmicro  package to use the new segment type MessageProducerSegment  and the new attribute constants: nrmicro.ClientWrapper  now uses newrelic.MessageProducerSegments instead of newrelic.ExternalSegments for calls to Client.Publish . nrmicro.SubscriberWrapper  updates transaction names and adds the attribute message.routingKey. Updated the nrnats  and nrstan  packages to use the new segment type MessageProducerSegment  and the new attribute constants: nrnats.StartPublishSegment  now starts and returns a newrelic.MessageProducerSegment type. nrnats.SubWrapper  and nrstan.StreamingSubWrapper  updates transaction names and adds the attributes message.routingKey, message.queueName, and message.replyTo.",

Transaction.GetLinkingMetadata() returns a LinkingMetadata  which contains the fields needed to link data to a trace or entity. Added a new plugin for the Logrus logging framework  with the new _integrations/logcontext/nrlogrusplugin  package. This plugin leverages the new GetTraceMetadata and GetLinkingMetadata above to decorate logs. To enable, set your log's formatter to the nrlogrusplugin.ContextFormatter{} The logger will now look for a newrelic.Transaction inside its context and decorate logs accordingly. Therefore, the Transaction must be added to the context and passed to the logger. For example, this logging call must be transformed to include the context, such as: For full documentation see the godocs  or view the example . Added support for NATS  and NATS Streaming  monitoring with the new _integrations/nrnats  and _integrations/nrstan  packages. These packages support instrumentation of publishers and subscribers. NATS Example NATS Streaming Example Enables ability to migrate to Configurable Security Policies (CSP)  on a per agent basis for accounts already using High-security mode (HSM) . Previously, if CSP was configured for an account, New Relic would not allow an agent to connect without the security_policies_token. This led to agents not being able to connect during the period between when CSP was enabled for an account and when each agent is configured with the correct token. With this change, when both HSM and CSP are enabled for an account, an agent (this version or later) can successfully connect with either high_security: true or the appropriate security_policies_token configured - allowing the agent to continue to connect after CSP is configured on the account but before the appropriate security_policies_token is configured for each agent.",

    "description": "2.1.0 New Go Agent now supports distributed tracing Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through your distributed system. By showing the distributed activity through a unified view, you can troubleshoot and understand a complex system better than ever before. Distributed tracing is available with an APM Pro or equivalent subscription. To see a complete distributed trace, you need to enable the feature on a set of neighboring services. Enabling distributed tracing changes the behavior of some New Relic features, so carefully consult the transition guide  before you enable this feature. To enable distributed tracing, set the following fields in your config. Note that distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. Please refer to the distributed tracing section of the guide  for more detail on how to ensure you get the most out of the Go agent's distributed tracing support. New distributed trace calls/functions Added functions NewContext  and FromContext  for adding and retrieving the Transaction from a Context. Handlers instrumented by WrapHandle , WrapHandleFunc , and nrgorilla.InstrumentRoutes  may use FromContext  on the request's context to access the Transaction. Thanks to @caarlos0 for the contribution! Though NewContext  and FromContext  require Go 1.7+ (when context  was added), RequestWithTransactionContext  is always exported so that it can be used in all framework and library instrumentation.",

    "description": "2.0.0 New The End() functions defined on the Segment, DatastoreSegment, and ExternalSegment types now receive the segment as a pointer, rather than as a value. This prevents unexpected behaviour when a call to End() is deferred before one or more fields are changed on the segment. In practice, this is likely to only affect this pattern: Instead, you will now need to separate the literal from the deferred call: When creating custom and external segments, we recommend using newrelic.StartSegment()  and newrelic.StartExternalSegment() , respectively. Added GoDoc badge to README. Thanks to @mrhwick for the contribution! Config.UseTLS configuration setting has been removed to increase security. TLS will now always be used in communication with New Relic Servers.",
